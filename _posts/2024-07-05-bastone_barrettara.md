title: "Mozart's Osmin and the Phrasing of Discomposure"
author: "Danielle Bastone Barrettara"
abstract: "Perhaps the most memorable character in Mozart's *Die Entführung aus dem
Serail* is Osmin, the grumpy harem overseer whose angry antics receive
some of the cleverest dramaturgic settings in the opera. Analysts often
seek to identify moments in which Osmin's music assumes a narrative
function, taking their cues in part from a letter in which Mozart
explains the dramatic justification for his bolder choices of key and
meter as expressions of Osmin's rage. And though commentaries of this
sort are illuminating and comprise much of the literature on Osmin, they
generally neglect to account for the metric phenomena of the musical
dramaturgy. This essay demonstrates how Mozart uses varied phrase
structures, hypermetric deferment, and text-setting as dramaturgic tools
in the portrayal of Osmin's discomposure across his three solo numbers."
footnote_1: "I am grateful to Mark Anson-Cartwright, Loretta Terrigno, and Allan W. Atlas for comments and insights that strengthened every draft of this article. Important studies among these include Melamed (2010) on the use of Osmin's low register in contrapuntal settings, Gruber (1994) on musical heterogeneity in \"Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen,\" and both Bauman (1987, 62--71) and Mahling (1973) on the dramaturgic use of the eighteenth-century *alla turca* style in Osmin's music. For more general considerations of Osmin's character, see Abert ([1919--1921] 2007, 658--85), Betzwieser (1991), and Fábián (1989). For a concise and eloquent account of the syntactical musical challenge that Osmin's rage presented Mozart, see Kivy (1999, 59--61). "
footnote_2: "It should be noted that the distinctive low notes and broad leaps of Osmin's vocal lines, though often employed dramaturgically by Mozart, were included in no small part to exploit the particular abilities of Ludwig Fischer (1745--1825), the star bass-baritone who premiered the role. Fischer was known for his exceptionally wide range as well as for the fluidity with which he traversed it. For more on his life, voice, and Viennese popularity, see Fischer (2016) and Bauman (1987). "
footnote_3: "For broader reflections on the relationship between rhythm and meter, see Rothstein (1989; 2008; 2011) and Hasty (1997); on this relationship in Mozart's music, see Mirka (2009) and Klorman (2016). "
footnote_4: "In a quadruple hypermeasure, for instance, the first measure is strong, the second weak, the third slightly less strong than the first, and the fourth weakest of all. The term \"hypermeasure\" originates in Cone (1968). "
footnote_5: "For analyses that probe the expressive potential of irregular hypermeter, see Cohn (1992) and Rodgers (2011). On types of metric dissonances beyond the hypermetric, see Krebs (1987). "
footnote_6: "^6^ Rothstein observes that pieces which intentionally invoke improvisation, such as the Baroque toccata or Classical fantasia, \"avoid forming hypermeasures in order to preserve a rhapsodic or capricious quality\" (1989, 13). "
footnote_7: "Such accents, as Malin importantly qualifies, are not the type dependent upon the interpretation of the performer but rather those that inherently \"draw attention to themselves\" (2010, 41); Krebs further notes that they can represent \"any perceptible deviation from an established pattern\" (1999, 23). Regarding the assessment of strong and weak measures, see also Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) and Rothstein (2011); for more on the determination of metric hierarchy within and outside of hypermeter, see Malin (2010, 35--66). "
footnote_8: "The *accento comune* is the accented penultimate syllable typical of Italian verse. "
footnote_9: "As summarized by Rothstein, metrical preference rules (MPRs) \"provide criteria for deciding which of the possible structures is preferred by a listener in a given instance\" (2011, 94). These include, for example, the \"Harmony Rule\" (aligning strong beats with harmonic changes) and the \"Linguistic Stress Rule\" (aligning strong beats with stressed syllables). For more on MPRs see Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), Temperley (2001), and Rothstein (2011). "
footnote_10: "It should be noted that despite this recommendation, Rothstein (2008; 2011) encourages flexibility in metric analysis, cautioning against the blanket application of theories with \"German bias\" to Italian- and French-language music and exploring how poetic accent can render measures strong and weak (and especially so at phrase endings). "
footnote_11: "Another important example, though a bit more modest than those cited above, is Elvira's offset entrance in \"Ah, chi mi dice mai\" as a symptom of her bewilderment (Allanbrook 1986, 234). For an additional analysis of meter and text-setting in \"Ach, Belmonte! ach mein Leben,\" see Bastone (2017, 199--224). "
footnote_12: "It is worth noting that *Die Entführung aus dem Serail* premiered on July 16, 1782, at Vienna's Burgtheater. Mozart set a libretto adapted especially for him by Gottlieb Stephanie der Jüngere (director of Joseph II's National Singspiel) from an original by Christoph Friedrich Bretzner titled *Belmont und Constanze*. "
footnote_13: "For a thorough account of the indebtedness of the Singspiel to French and other international models, see Reiber (1994). Abert's commentary on this topic also endures ([1919--1921] 2007, 643--57). "
footnote_14: "We will have occasion to revisit the roots of Osmin's character type below, but on its crudeness and prevalence in the Oriental Singspiel, see Baron-Woods (2008, 72--74) and Hunter (1998); on musical and dramatic norms for buffo roles in opera buffa, see Platoff (1990) and Hunter (1999, 95--155); and on Osmin's links to the buffo tradition, see Abert ([1919--1921] 2007, 659--61). "
footnote_15: "Osmin's small outburst midway through the third stanza (mm. 40--44) poses a melodic but not structural change to that verse. "
footnote_16: "A suffix is a type of expansion that extends the concluding harmony of a phrase but sits outside the established hypermeter. For more on this common device, see Rothstein (1989, 70--73). One could make the case that m. 15 is a hypermetric elision, as described by Burkhart (1994), but I prefer viewing it as a suffix because Osmin's second-beat \"Tra-la\" exhibits a parallel hypermetric function to the vocal upbeats in mm. 2, 6, and 10, which precede hyperbeats. This parallelism is, to my ear, quite pronounced in performance, especially because of the mid-measure rests in the accompaniment (in m. 15). "
footnote_17: "For more on hypermetric transitions in Mozart (and beyond), see Temperley (2008) and Bakulina (2017). "
footnote_18: "A trochee consists of a stressed (or \"long\") syllable followed by an unstressed (or \"short\") syllable. Trochaic tetrameter, trimeter, and dimeter feature four, three, and two trochees per poetic line, respectively. "
footnote_19: "For more on the common features of eighteenth-century *alla turca* style, see Schubart ([1806] 1975), Ratner (1980), Hunter (1998), and Locke (2009); for more on Mozart's use of it in the *Entführung*, see Baumann (1987). "
footnote_20: "Mozart asked Stephanie to expand Osmin's role, at least in part, to help win the audience's favor. The Viennese loved to laugh and they loved to hear Ludwig Fischer (the singer who premiered the part); Osmin's increased presence ensured they would have more of both. For more on this calculation and the long gestation of the *Entführung* libretto, see Bauman (1987). "
footnote_21: "On the Type 2 sonata form, see Hepokoski-Darcy (2006, 353--87). In Example 3b and throughout this analysis, P = primary theme, TR = transition, S = secondary theme, C = closing zone, and the apostrophe (') represents the medial caesura. By \"rotation,\" I refer to a full \"cycle through the governing layout (P TR ' S),\" including post-S closing zones, where they exist (Hepokoski-Darcy 2006, 353). "
footnote_22: "That Rotation 2 begins with P in the submediant rather than the dominant represents for Hepokoski-Darcy a second-level default (2006, 373). In *Idomeneo*, Mozart twice similarly represents Elettra's mental instability at the same formal juncture: her \"Tutte nel cor vi sento\" is in D minor but begins its Rotation 2 in C minor and her \"D'Oreste d'ajace\" is in C minor but begins its Rotation 2 over a chromatic passage (and then the dominant). "
footnote_23: "The five-measure phrase (mm. 12--16), as shown in Example 6, is comprised of 4 + 1. Example 6 interprets mm. 12--16 as projecting a regular alternation of strong and weak measures. One could convincingly argue that all of these measures are strong owing to the similar rhythmic contents of mm. 12--15 and the ***fp*** markings that punctuate each downbeat. I favor the alteration of strong and weak measures because of the suspensions in the winds, which clearly mark only the downbeat of m. 12. "
footnote_24: "Allanbrook (1983) insightfully discusses the (extra)musical significance of *alla breve* meter in the broader eighteenth century as well as in Mozart's operas. "
footnote_25: "We will have cause to discuss the *ottonario* in more detail below, but regarding this common setting, see Webster (1991, 130--40) and Lippmann (1978); on the related \"Italian barring,\" see Rothstein (2008; 2011). "
footnote_26: "I interpret the alternating strong and weak measures in this six-measure passage according to Rothstein's \"Parallelism Rule,\" which is rooted in the early-twentieth-century work of Eugen Tetzel: \"When a motive is immediately repeated at the same or another pitch level, in the same or another voice, the strongest beat in the first statement is normally stronger than the strongest beat in the second statement\" (2011, 96). I read m. 22 as strong because of the accented downbeat, which occurs after three beats of rest. "
footnote_27: "I interpret Osmin's m. 23 as strong according to two MPRs outlined by Rothstein (2011, 96): the \"Event Rule,\" which aligns strong beats with event-onsets (the event being Osmin's reentrance after a full measure of rest), and the aforementioned Linguistic Stress Rule (the preference to align a strong beat with a strong syllable). "
footnote_28: "By \"multivalent interpretation,\" I build on the term \"multivalence\" as defined by Webster (1991, 103--4): \"temporal patternings\" of various \"domains\" (rhythm, meter, melodic content, text, etc.) \"are not necessarily congruent and may even be incompatible,\" and \"the resulting complexity and lack of unity is often a primary source of their effect.\" "
footnote_29: "Burton hears this shift to recitative-like style as a marker of Osmin's \"unsteadiness\" and borrows the Greek term *metabole* to describe the illustrative musical function of the pauses (2004, 366--73). Burton presents a sensitive analysis of the aria, taking into account the dramatic implications of phrasing and meter (especially in the second coda). "
footnote_30: "The only significant (non-harmonic) difference between P in Rotations 1 and 2 is the compression of mm. 18--19 into one (m. 72). "
footnote_31: "Webster also rightly observes that when Mozart remarked to his father during the composition of the *Entführung* that \"verses are doubtless the most indispensable thing for music,\" he likely meant that \"poetic lines . . . imply tangible rhythmic profiles\" (1991, 132). For another excellent source on Mozart's rhythmic profiles and how they compare in his settings of German and Italian texts, see Lippmann (1978). On rhythmic profiles and their dramaturgic functions in the *Entführung*, see Bastone (2017, 49--84). "
footnote_32: "Mozart explained to his father, in the same letter quoted at the outset of this article, that \"[t]he passage 'Drum beim Barte des Propheten' is indeed in the same tempo, but with quick notes,\" implying that the faster declamation was meant to reflect Osmin's \"gradually\" increasing rage (Anderson 1997, 769). "
footnote_33: "Hepokoski-Darcy calls this TR the \"defining feature\" of the sonata-rondo (2006, 394), repeatedly noting that when A and B are \"merely juxtaposed thematic blocks\" with no transition between them, the formal structure does \"not rise fully to the level of the 'sonata-rondo' in the strictest sense of the term\" (2006, 402--4). It should be noted that episodes 2 and 3 of \"O! wie will ich triumphieren\" do feature at their conclusions transitional passages of dominant preparation for the return of the tonic refrain. "
footnote_34: "Although offered at a different pitch level, Osmin's expansion via \"schnüren zu\" is a textual and rhythmic repetition that recalls Kirnberger's concept of echo-repetition: \"one can repeat the last measure of a three-measure phrase as an echo and thus form from them a rhythmic unit of four measures\" ([1793] 1982, 410). "
footnote_35: "Rodgers (2011) as well as De Souza (2019), who notably reports a corpus study of hypermetrical irregularity in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century symphonic sonata movements, both observe the rarity of extended passages of triple hypermeter. "
footnote_36: "Truncated refrains were common in the second and third rotations in of the late-eighteenth-century rondo (see Hepokoski-Darcy 2006, 388--403). Section A′′ diverges from A at m. 199, where Osmin delves into obsessive textual fragmentation that the orchestra underpins with incessant cadential gestures in order that he might finish the aria with a real bang. A quadruple hypermeter persists throughout. Of this vocal material, Abert wrote that \"Osmin is no longer capable of forming an orderly melodic line but simply avails himself of odd phrases and fragments of his main theme, flogging them to death in his delight at the thought of imminently strangling his enemies\" ([1919--1921] 2007, 683). "
footnote_37: "The second violins begin with an ascending minor third in mm. 87--88 but follow the stepwise pattern of the violas, cellos, and basses thereafter. "
footnote_38: "The ***fp*** marking, registral shift, and change of accompanimental figuration are tempting reasons to interpret m. 96 as metrically strong. I favor hearing it as weak, though, because it prolongs the G minor harmony attained in m. 95 (an unequivocally strong measure) through to m. 97. Moreover, even strong accents like the downbeat ***fp*** of m. 96 do not automatically oblige strong measures; Cone asserts that \"there is no necessary correlation between strong measures and dynamic accents\" (1968, 31). "
footnote_39: "The repetition features new figuration in the accompaniment and the inclusion of the oboe and bassoon (not shown in Example 11); additionally, the harmonic goal is the dominant of D in preparation for the refrain's return in m. 132. We might also note that the low strings and vocal part suggest a canon between mm. 111--119, subtly echoing the \"stalking\" narrative first introduced in mm. 87--95. (I am indebted to an anonymous reader of *Theory and Practice* for this clever observation.) "
footnote_40: "The quoted passage is that which opens the aria's second coda with the text \"Erst geköpft, dann gehangen\" (in the aria, starting at m. 147; in the finale, at m. 75). "
footnote_41: "On Osmin's interest in Blonde and its effect on his character, see Fábián (1989), Mahling (1973), and Joncus (2010). "
footnote_42: "Osmin continues with a regular quadruple hypermeter thereafter."

When Mozart wrote to his father on September 26, 1781, about the
composition of *Die Entführung aus dem Serail*, he could hardly have
known that his letter would rouse so much interest among readers other
than its addressee. And he might have been pleased at the fuss we have
made, centuries later, over his proud justification of the
unconventional second coda in Osmin's first-act aria, "Solche
hergelauf'ne Laffen":

> \[A]s Osmin's rage gradually increases, there comes (just when the
> aria seems to be at an end) the allegro assai, which is in a totally
> different meter and in a different key; this is bound to be very
> effective. For just as a man in such a towering rage oversteps all the
> bounds of order, moderation, and propriety and completely forgets
> himself, so must the music too forget itself. But since passions must
> never offend the ear, but must please the listener, or in other words
> never cease to be *music*, so I have not chosen \[for the second
> coda] a key foreign to F (in which the aria is written) but one
> related to it---not the nearest, D minor, but the more remote A minor.
> <footer>Anderson 1997, 769</footer>

Mozart knew that "Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen" presented a highly
individual and dramatically sensitive musical characterization while
remaining coherent within the harmonic-structural syntax of
late-eighteenth-century music. He also seems to have known that he
really "outdid" himself with the portrayal.

The above quotation has long served as a critical tool for the
identification of musical tokens of rage throughout "Solche hergelauf'ne
Laffen" and the six other numbers in which Osmin sings, an analytical
endeavor that accounts for much of the literature on his character. The
letter's emphasis on tonal relationships, in particular, has prompted us
to privilege matters of pitch, contrast, and extremes as symptoms of
that rage. Thus many insightful commentaries observe the wide vocal
leaps, chromatic coloratura, cavernously low passages, and alternating
paces of declamation that frequently punctuate Osmin's vocal lines, the
fluctuating dynamic and varied expressive markings that lend volatility
to his accompaniments, and the "Turkish" orchestration that
distinguishes him from his Western interlocutors.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='1' footnote_text=page.footnote_1%} Taken together,
studies of this sort have demonstrated the consistency of Mozart's
musical approach to Osmin's hostility across the opera.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='2' footnote_text=page.footnote_2%}

It is thus curious, given the bounty to which Mozart's treasure map of a
letter has led us, that we have largely ignored his plain statement that
*meter* also contributes to the depiction of Osmin's unbridled
expression. In fact, it would seem that Mozart considered the change of
meter an integral component of the musical characterization, asserting
as he does that it is the combination of harmonic and metrical shifts
together that are "bound to be very effective." The possibility
therefore exists that meter plays a more central dramaturgic function in
Osmin's music than we have previously acknowledged. And if we broaden
our conception of meter to encompass a variety of metric and rhythmic
phenomena (as we have similarly allowed Mozart's description of remote
key relationships to inspire a more general inquiry of musical
contrasts), we will be well positioned to identify new ways in which the
music of a man in such a towering rage might assume dramatic
significance.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='3' footnote_text=page.footnote_3%}

Accordingly, this study examines how Mozart uses variable vocal phrase
structures, hypermetric deferment, and text-setting as dramaturgic tools
in the depiction of Osmin's discomposure. As the analyses will
demonstrate, Osmin struggles to deliver balanced phrases or adopt a
regular hypermeter whenever his emotions intensify throughout his arias
"Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen" and "O! wie will ich triumphieren." The
resulting metric, rhythmic, and textual tensions evoke in both numbers a
musico-dramatic disorientation similar to the "forgetfulness" described
by Mozart in his letter. This study will also observe how Osmin's
introductory aria, "Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden," previews his
propensity for metric irregularity.

Before delving into the analyses, I shall set down some basic
definitions. By "hypermeter," I refer to recurring groups of three or
four measures called hypermeasures that can be perceived by the listener
as metric units. The constituent measures of a hypermeasure are
alternatingly "strong" and "weak" based on their relative positions.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='4' footnote_text=page.footnote_4%}
Irregularities of different sorts can occur within an established
hypermeter: the music may switch between duple and triple groups, for
instance, or a pattern may be interrupted by the interpolation of a
measure of unexpected strength.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='5' footnote_text=page.footnote_5%} The emergence of hypermeter cannot
be taken for granted, even in the highly structured music of the late
eighteenth century; indeed, I will argue that an erratic projection of
strong and weak measures at the start of Osmin's second aria delays
hypermetric entrainment.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='6' footnote_text=page.footnote_6%} To assess how and when hypermeter does or
does not emerge, we can identify strong and weak measures based on a
variety of parameters: harmonic departures and arrivals, melodic
segments, repetitions, contour, the entries and (sub)phrases of
participating voices, and accents of any kind (agogic, dynamic,
registral, syllabic, textural, ornamentation, harmonic/melodic
dissonance, etc.).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='7' footnote_text=page.footnote_7%}

By "vocal phrase," I refer to a melodic segment circumscribed primarily
by the poetic text and the pauses necessitated by the singer's breathing
and secondarily by melodic, harmonic, cadential, and rhythmic content.
Vocal phrases and the phrase structures they comprise are distinct from
the phrases and phrase structures conveyed by harmonic progressions or
the orchestral accompaniment. Vocal phrase structures therefore may or
may not coincide with other phrase structures or with the hypermeter. In
fact, the "agreement or conflict" of phrase structure and hypermeter
"represents a basic compositional resource" (Rothstein 1989, 13) that
can be used toward dramaturgic ends.

The majority of Osmin's vocal phrases exhibit what William Rothstein
calls "neutral barring," or phrases that cadence on downbeats and begin
with either a short upbeat or none at all (2008, 116). This organization
derives in part from the structure of the libretto: German verse lacks
an *accento comune*, so the principal stress of a line is determined by
textual meaning rather than accentual pattern.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='8' footnote_text=page.footnote_8%} Phrases do not, then,
need to move toward an aligned textual accent and cadence, as Italian
verse routinely demands. When prioritizing the metrical preference rules
that will guide my analyses, I will thus generally privilege the
"Grouping Rule," or "the preference to locate strong beats near the
beginning of groups" (Temperley 2001, 357); Lerdahl and Jackendoff
(1983, 76) identify this as the "Strong Beat Early" rule.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='9' footnote_text=page.footnote_9%} Indeed,
Rothstein recommends the precedence of the Grouping Rule in the analysis
of German vocal music only "unless other metrical preference rules
strongly contradict it" (2011, 97).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='10' footnote_text=page.footnote_10%} (Of course, there arise such
exceptional cases in Osmin's music and due sensitivity will be afforded
them throughout.)

To be clear, the dramaturgic application of hypermetric and phrasal
irregularity in Mozart's operas is by no means limited to the
characterization of Osmin, to instances of discomposure, to the
German-language works, or to the mature operas. One readily finds
examples across Mozart's operatic oeuvre in which metric imbalances and
asymmetrical phrase structures bear the burden of storytelling. To note
only a salient few: the alternating phrase lengths that correspond to
infidelity and constancy in Bastien's aria "Geh! du sagst mir eine
Fabel" (Tyler 1990, 547); the conflicting hypermeter between singer and
orchestra at the outset of Donna Anna's "Or sai chi l'onore" to help
portray that heroine's steeliness (Schachter 1980, 12); the fluctuating
phrase lengths and irregular hypermeter of "Là ci darem la mano" to
underscore the Don's methodical seduction of Zerlina (Burkart 1991); the
offset phrasing of Idamante and the orchestra to amplify his lonely
plight at the opening of the *Idomeneo* quartet (Heartz 1980); the
odd-numbered vocal phrase structures of "Alles fühlt der Liebe Freuden"
that capture Monostatos's emotional distress (Bastone 2017, 183); and,
in another example from the *Entführung*, Konstanze's weak-measure
entrances in "Ach, Belmonte! ach mein Leben" and subsequent shift from
German to Franco-Italian phrasing to convey her assertiveness and
strength (Rumph 2005, 184).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='11' footnote_text=page.footnote_11%}

These examples highlight the powerful and varied dramaturgic potential
of meter and phrasing in Mozart's hands. By and large, past studies have
probed this potential through analyses of individual numbers; my goal
here is to take a step toward broader considerations by engaging a full
"network" of arias. This handy term of James Webster's denotes a group
of arias that share any number of dramatic resemblances (character type,
dramatic content, operatic genre, language, etc.) and musical
resemblances (voice type, aria type, instrumentation, key, meter, form,
etc.) (Webster 1991). The full set of a character's solo numbers can
also constitute a network, or even just part of one. In taking up the
network of Osmin's solo offerings, we can explore Mozart's strategic use
of meter and phrase structure across a complete characterization. It is
my hope that this study lays the groundwork for similar analyses of even
larger networks toward wide-ranging comparisons and conclusions.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='12' footnote_text=page.footnote_12%}

<h2>Osmin's Introduction</h2>

Osmin sings about the fickle fidelities of women and the capitalizing
designs of men who would lure them from their partners throughout his
cautionary introductory Lied, "Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden." It is a
diegetic song, or one that would be sung in real life, and derives in
part from two operatic traditions. Strophic folk-like songs of the sort
were popular in *opéra comique* and subsequently in the Singspiel, the
older French genre having served as a frequent blueprint in the early
development of its German counterpart.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='13' footnote_text=page.footnote_13%} (Pedrillo's "In Mohrenland
gefangen war" \[No. 18], the strophic and enchantingly modal Romanze
that initiates the abduction scene in Act 3, belongs to the same class.)
Osmin's griping about feminine inconstancy, though, is typical of his
own Turkish servant character type (which itself betrays some influence
of the buffo tradition, with such complaining being customary for
middle- and lower-class men of the opera buffa stage).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='14' footnote_text=page.footnote_14%} Yet with its
trudging tempo, chromatically inflected minor mode, and slithering
accompanimental winds, "Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden" forebodes in a
manner atypical of its models. There are two dramatically motivated
reasons for this. First, Osmin's text suggests that infidelity is the
likely outcome of all romantic relationships, and Mozart's gloomy
setting reflects (what Osmin believes to be) that unfortunate
inevitability. Second, the Lied exposes the wariness with which Osmin
navigates the world, a misgiving that will prompt and guide virtually
all of his behavior throughout the opera. This little Lied---which
Hermann Abert praised as "the first time in the history of the German
Singspiel \[that] an entirely simple song is adapted to the character"
([1919--1921] 2007, 670)---thus establishes the motivation behind all
of the grief Osmin will cause the Western protagonists in the acts to
come.

"Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden" also anticipates the irregularities of
vocal phrase structure and hypermeter that will pervade Osmin's later
arias. The Lied is in G minor, 6/8 meter, and varied strophic form,
although the accompaniment changes more substantially than does the
vocal part as the song unfolds. Three six-line stanzas of trochaic
tetrameter comprise the text, which is provided in [Example 1](#ex-1). Mozart sets each stanza as a verse with the same
phrase structure, so we can take the first verse, which is provided in
[Example 2](#ex-2), to represent all three.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='15' footnote_text=page.footnote_15%} In this
example as well as in those that follow, arrows indicate measure
strength (↓ = strong; ↑ = weak); horizontal brackets with Arabic
numbers, placed above the staves, indicate hypermeasures; and dotted
lines above the vocal part delineate vocal phrase lengths, which
represent my own hearing of phrase structure without any necessary
correspondence to slurs in Mozart's score.

The first two couplets each outfit a four-measure vocal phrase
(comprised of two two-measure subphrases) that aligns with a
hypermeasure (see mm. 3--6, 7--10). Mozart next fashions a couplet out
of line five ("sei ihr Tröster, sei ihr Freund") by similarly setting it
twice in a four-measure vocal phrase (and hypermeasure) in mm. 11--14. A
fragmented repetition of the line's final three syllables follows in a
suffix echo at the lower octave in mm. 14--15.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='16' footnote_text=page.footnote_16%} This suffix
interrupts the quadruple hypermeter by forcing a metrically weak measure
between the end of one hypermeasure and the beginning of another. It
also causes a hypermetric shift between each verse. The first verse
projects, to borrow Temperley's term, an "odd-strong" pattern, or a
hypermeter in which odd-numbered measures are strong (2008, 305--6).
Because of the suffix, though, the final hypermeasure of the first verse
begins in an even-numbered measure (m. 16), and the second verse
proceeds in m. 20 with an "even-strong" pattern (a hypermeter in which
even-numbered measures are strong) until its suffix in m. 32. This
suffix then causes a reversion to odd-strong patterning in m. 33 that
sustains for the entire third verse.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='17' footnote_text=page.footnote_17%} The Lied's slow tempo makes
this shift more difficult to perceive than it might be in a faster
setting, and because Mozart incorporates the disruptive suffix into all
three stanzas, it becomes an expected, almost normalized quirk by its
third occurrence. Still, these subtle hypermetric abnormalities hint at
Osmin's penchant for metric unevenness and ensures that the Lied
introduces not only his most salient personality traits but his musical
idiosyncrasies as well.

In terms of poetic meter, "Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden"---being
comprised entirely of trochaic tetrameter---sets a precedent for all of
Osmin's solo material: "Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen" contains a mix of
trochaic dimeter, trimeter, and tetrameter, and "O! wie will ich
triumphieren" also uses trochaic tetrameter exclusively.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='18' footnote_text=page.footnote_18%} Trochees
are Osmin's textual default. The reason is twofold. First, trochaic
tetrameter is also the sole poetic meter of the opera's two Janissary
choruses (Nos. 5 and 21b), which along with Osmin's solo numbers,
incorporate to varying degrees Mozart's "Turkish" musical gestures:
raised fourth scale degrees, foregrounded use of piccolo, oboe, or
triangle, 2/4 meter, melodies with prominent repetitive thirds or
repeated single notes, and, notably, pronounced downbeats, which find
their natural textual complement in trochaic meters.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='19' footnote_text=page.footnote_19%} Trochees are
therefore a rhythmic element of Osmin's Eastern coloration. Second,
trochees suit Osmin's demeanor and communicative style. The emphasized
first syllable enables him to begin his every utterance with strength,
while the subsequent straightforward alternation between hard and soft
seems to reflect something of his obdurate nature and simplemindedness.
This use of nothing other than trochaic meters in his solo numbers also
underscores the extremity and inflexibility of the opinions expressed
within them (e.g., all women are disloyal, all men are opportunists, all
foreigners are repugnant).

"Wer ein Liebchen hat gefunden" aligns musical and textual accents
without exception (excluding the subjugation of some strong syllables to
eighth-note pickups, for which neutral barring allows). But in Osmin's
next arias, Mozart occasionally and dramaturgically obfuscates the
trochaic patterning with unexpected accents and disproportionate verse
dispersion to depict a more agitated Osmin. Because Osmin sings to a
trochaic standard, these anomalies make for easily perceptible
deviations that betray his weakening self-command.

Before confronting the two comedic but violent arias that make Osmin a
Mozartian household name, a word on the roots of his character is in
order. Osmin is a conflation of several musico-dramatic factors and
traditions: the increasingly sophisticated impulses of Mozart's maturing
dramatic sensibilities, the comic and musical tendencies of Osmin's
*opera buffa* counterparts, and the eighteenth-century European custom
of stereotyping the behavior, morals, and musical styles of those from
the East. Ralph Locke describes Osmin as a paragon of such caricature,
writing that he is "unquestionably nasty, and his nastiness is
understood as tied up with his adherence to real or supposed Turkish
customs of his day" (2009, 322). Indeed, lowborn male characters of
Ottoman lineage were often afforded the very worst of Western beliefs
about their ethnicities and Islamic faith, their characterizations
marked by barbarity, superstition, lasciviousness, indulgence, and
hypocrisy. These traits were almost invariably underscored by the
instrumentation and compositional devices of the *alla turca* style,
itself a caricature of sorts, which Mary Hunter persuasively argues was
"associated with extreme masculinity (bravado, fierceness, an obsessive
interest in domination)" and then "mapped, in a classically
Orientalizing manner, onto clear markers of ethnic difference" (1998,
57).

Mozart seems to have recognized Osmin's rage as both a universally human
emotion and as a distinctly uncivilized Turkish one. His letter to his
father, quoted above, does not impute such overwhelming anger to Turkish
men exclusively, and it is conceivable that Mozart himself had recently
suffered from some rage-induced forgetfulness: his struggles with the
Archbishop Colloredo transpired earlier that very year. Still, markers
of "Turkishness" permeate Osmin's characterization, the comedy of which
relies on his overeager thuggish urges and lack of emotional restraint
together with diverse and copious applications of the *alla turca*
style. To be sure, Osmin bears musical and dramatic responsibilities
beyond those of the typical eighteenth-century operatic Turkish
servant---his role was expanded by the librettist at Mozart's
behest---but it is important to remember that he remains in many ways a
product of the ill-founded Eastern stereotyping so commonplace in
Austria at the close of the eighteenth century.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='20' footnote_text=page.footnote_20%}

<h2>Osmin's Anger</h2>

"Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen" is in F major, common time, and marked
*allegro con brio*. Its text is provided in [Example 3a](#ex-3a). My analysis begins with a brief review of its form,
an outline of which, based on the Type 2 sonata identified by
Hepokoski-Darcy (2006), is provided in [Example 3b](#ex-3b).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='21' footnote_text=page.footnote_21%} Rotation 2 contains the defining features of
this type: it begins with a full off-tonic presentation of P as a
developmental space before a tonic presentation of S supplies the tonal
resolution.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='22' footnote_text=page.footnote_22%} In both rotations, P and S are separated by transitions
in which Osmin importantly takes part. And the post-rotational codas, of
course, introduce new music and text, the second being cast in A minor
(rather than the expected F major) and 3/4 time to ensure that both man
and music "forget" themselves. It is essential to remember that the
dramatic impact of the meter change would have impressed more strongly
upon the opera's original audience than it does upon modern ears, since
eighteenth-century listeners were accustomed to the relative fixedness
of meter within individual pieces and movements. As Danuta Mirka writes:
"In the eighteenth century the constancy of notated meter was taken for
granted by both composers and listeners. Virtually every piece or
movement was written with one time signature from beginning to end"
(2008, 83).

Gerold Gruber descriptively writes that Osmin "crashes, trips, and
stumbles" (1994, 494; my translation) into the aria, an impression he
derives from the chromatic melisma of the opening passage and the
half-measure pause that follows it. Yet one could argue further that it
takes Osmin until S (of the exposition) to find surer footing, as
fluctuating vocal phrase lengths and the erratic projection of strong
and weak measures permeate P and TR with imbalances that delay the
establishment of a hypermeter. Osmin's fitful phrasing accommodates the
overwrought expressions of a man teeming with anger.

[Example 4](#ex-4) provides the seven-measure phrase with which
Osmin enters the aria in unison with the strings but purposefully omits
the aria's first measure, an F-major chord with fermata for the strings
alone. It is unlikely that the chord was ever part of Mozart's
conception. As Gerold Croll writes in the critical notes of the *Neue
Mozart Ausgabe*:

> The question of whether \[the measure] was originally by Mozart

><footer>trans. William Buchanan, <em>Critical Report</em></footer>

That Ludwig Fischer, the first Osmin, would have needed such aid seems
doubtful given his noted abilities. Moreover, if he had fumbled the
note, Mozart probably would have complained about it: on July 20, 1782,
he reported to his father that Johann Ernst Dauer (the first Pedrillo)
and Fischer bungled the opening of the first-act Trio in performance. "I
was in such a rage," Mozart recalled, ". . . that I was simply beside
myself and said at once that I would not let the opera be given again
without having a short rehearsal for the singers" (Anderson 1997, 808).
Tending to agree with Croll's assessment that the first measure is not
Mozart's own, I will not account for it here.

interpretations.' %}


Osmin's opening gambit is what Hepokoski-Darcy would call a "weak-launch
option": a P that opens *piano* with "the onset of some sort of bustling
*crescendo* effect" (2006, 66). The phrase presents and prolongs the
tonic note for five measures (mm. 2--6) before launching a chromatic
ascent to the dominant (mm. 7--8). A melisma on the first syllable of
"Laffen" ("dandies") starts on the downbeat of m. 4 and occupies more
than half of the phrase. It is a brooding and asymmetrical preamble that
anticipates Osmin's imminent eruption. It is also a bit fiddly to parse.

One could make the case, as shown in [Example 5](#ex-5), for a
regular alternation of strong and weak measures. Measure 2 is strong
because of Osmin's entrance; m. 3 is weak because the repeated unison F
extends the melodic and harmonic stagnation. Measure 4 follows as strong
(even though it, too, contains repetitions of F) owing to the agogic
accent that sets a stressed syllable and sounds like the goal of the
previous measure. Measure 5, though nearly identical to m. 4, follows as
weak because its downbeat is marked ***p*** and does not receive a new
textual articulation from Osmin. Measure 6 is trickier, but we might
hear it as strong because it breaks from the repetition of the previous
two measures in favor of a livelier diminution of those measures' dotted
half and quarter notes. Measure 7 ensues as weak as Osmin offers a
gliding, rhythmically even prolongation of the melisma, the chromatic
ascent and crescendo of which generate momentum into the downbeat of the
strong m. 8, where Osmin abruptly concludes the phrase.

There are drawbacks to this interpretation, however. We are not
compelled to read m. 6 as strong. It requires some aural determination
to hear it as such, and we could just as easily mark it weak, as shown
in [Example 5](#ex-5), because it extends the melisma and
embellishes the tonic note as the previous three measures had done.
Moreover, the unnaturally accented fourth beats of mm. 4 and 5, both
punctuated with an ***sf*** and emphasized by a semitone trill, lessen
the impact of the downbeats of mm. 5 and 6.

Of these two possible hearings, I favor that of Example 5b because it
dramaturgically complements the text and text-setting. The passage
begins straightforwardly enough: the strong syllables of the trochaic
meter perceptibly align with strong musical beats (and the weak
syllables with weak beats) through the downbeat of m. 4, with agogic
accents on the downbeats of mm. 2 and 4 that help to render those
measures strong. Such deliberate declamation intoned on the tonic note
indicates that Osmin is in command of his emotions. But upon reaching
the word "Laffen" in m. 4---crucially the first direct reference to
those blasted "dandies"---Osmin abandons his orderly delivery and
wanders off in a melisma. The dotted rhythms of mm. 4--6 twitch with his
agitation, their emphasis on the semitone between E and F seeming to
reflect and widen a crack in his composure. He lingers so long on the
syllable "Laf-" that it takes a first-time listener four measures to
discern what word he even intends to sing. And the chromatic ascent of
m. 7 subverts the tonic before it is clear whether the tonality is major
or minor. To hear mm. 5--7 as metrically weak, then, is to understand
them as a lapse in Osmin's focus brought on by the mention of his
enemies. It is a small-scale application of the musico-dramatic premise
upon which Mozart will construct the second coda: just as Osmin loses
his train of thought while stewing about the *Laffen*, so too does his
music lose itself in a meandering succession of weak measures and
harmonic ambiguity.

The opening passage also serves as a catalyst for the irregular vocal
phrase structure that will prevent the establishment of a hypermeter
until the onset of S. [Example 6](#ex-6) provides an
interpretation of the vocal phrases in P and TR beginning at m. 8. To
begin, note the consecutive strong measures that mark Osmin's reentrance
(mm. 8, 9), delineate between two of his phrases (mm. 11, 12), and
accentuate the juncture between P and TR (mm. 18, 19). Note also,
beginning at m. 8, Osmin's odd-numbered and inconsistent phrase lengths:
3 + 5 + 3.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='23' footnote_text=page.footnote_23%}

{% include full_width_two_img.html

Such a volatile, pattern-avoidant phrase structure suggests that Osmin's
anger is *already* beginning to undermine his composure. The
text-setting and accompaniment evidence the same, especially so across
mm. 12--18. Osmin first presents the final line of the first stanza,
"mag ich vor den Teufel nicht," in a sequentially ascending *alla breve*
setting that ends over the subdominant (mm. 12--15), stranding him
without new text on inconclusive harmonic ground.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='24' footnote_text=page.footnote_24%} He then
impatiently repeats himself in a patter-like rhythmic diminution that
extends the melodic sequence in order to more quickly arrive at the
tonic (mm. 15--16). The resulting imperfect cadence is not strong enough
to conclude P, though, and Osmin is compelled to deliver the line a
third time in a broad Italianate *ottonario* setting over a perfect
authentic cadence (mm. 16--18).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='25' footnote_text=page.footnote_25%} Nearly half of P is thus devoted to
this single textual line, thrice offered in as many styles. Increasingly
frustrated, Osmin struggles not only to adopt balanced phrases, but to
align a decisive textual delivery with a decisive harmonic event. It is
dramatically significant, too, that the orchestra first diverges from
the vocal line just as Osmin begins this threefold delivery (the opening
ten measures having been offered in nearly perfect unison). Across mm.
12--14, the violins accompany Osmin with the motive marked "motive A" in
m. 12 of Example 6. As motive A sequentially rises with Osmin, its
downbeat ***fp***, impulsive triplet descents, and pecking eighth-note
repetitions reflect, if not agitate, Osmin's incipient rage.

Looking ahead, Osmin begins the transition with a three-measure phrase
that brusquely concludes in a strong measure (mm. 19--21, see Example
6). The orchestra continues without him in m. 22 as the first violins
reintroduce motive A and exchange it with the second violins in a rising
stepwise sequence across a six-measure passage of regularly alternating
strong and weak measures (mm. 22--27).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='26' footnote_text=page.footnote_26%} Despite the patent strength
of m. 22, though, Osmin reenters on the downbeat of the weak m. 23,
rendering it strong for his own part and forging ahead for four measures
in conflict with his accompaniment (as indicated by the arrows above the
vocal part in mm. 23--26 in Example 6).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='27' footnote_text=page.footnote_27%} This multivalent
interpretation recognizes the singer and orchestra as distinct agents
with a largely complementary but not interdependent relationship, each
agent possessing its own determinant elements that may or may not be
congruent with those of the other.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='28' footnote_text=page.footnote_28%} Here, Osmin's incongruous entry
suggests that his intensifying anger is already the cause of some
"forgetfulness."

The remainder of the transition unfolds like a recitative, Osmin
offering an *ad libitum* passage punctuated by rests and fermatas that
culminates in the medial caesura (see Example 6, mm. 27--31).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='29' footnote_text=page.footnote_29%} Being
the most salient and rhythmically active voice as well as the guiding
interpreter of the *ad libitum* marking, Osmin determines measure
strength throughout. The text-setting also suggests that Mozart has
purposefully foregrounded his part. In mm. 27 and 29, Mozart sets the
second, weak syllable of the trochee "doch mich" on the third, accented
beat, allowing Osmin to caution through undue emphasis that he should
not be underestimated ("but *me---I* cannot be deceived").

The whole passage hits a metric reset button, so to speak, for the aria.
When S begins in m. 32, Mozart immediately establishes a quadruple
hypermeter that he sustains until the arrival of Rotation 2. It is
important to note, though, that Rotation 2 reproduces the text and vocal
phrase structure of the exposition's P and TR almost exactly, so the
phrasal and metric disorder must be borne a second time---and off the
tonic, besides (see Example 3b).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='30' footnote_text=page.footnote_30%} Where the listener likely expects
the utmost stability, Mozart instead repeats the phrasal muddle and
prolongs the harmonic tension.

The irregular phrase structures and hypermetric deferral throughout P
and TR of "Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen" exhibit Osmin's disregard for
"order, moderation, and propriety" well before the arrival of the second
coda, for although his rage becomes most acute there, it is by no means
absent earlier in the form. Indeed, Osmin's eruption in the second coda
represents the culmination of a long and angry meditation that begins
with the aria's first phrase.

Osmin's anger also manifests musically in the sometimes-overlooked first
coda, where abnormalities of text-setting pop in a newfound fever pitch.
To appreciate this, we must first make a few general observations about
eighteenth-century text-setting. In the metered German and Italian
librettos of the time, the syllabic count and accentual pattern of each
poetic verse-type generated and limited the rhythmic options at a
composer's disposal for text-setting. Rhythmic profiles, to borrow James
Webster's term (1991, 130--40), are the rhythmic patterns suitable for
each verse-type owing to their arrangements of stressed and unstressed
beats. Some profiles were applicable to both German and Italian verse,
some were not; a number of profiles could be used for multiple poetic
verse-types, others could not. Eighteenth-century composers relied upon
these profiles, and they permeate the operatic literature of the
period.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='31' footnote_text=page.footnote_31%}

Up to the first coda of "Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen," Mozart calls upon
some of the most frequently used profiles for three- and four-stress
textual lines in German (and Italian) opera of the time. The first of
these is the pure *ottonario* profile, which privileges the third and
seventh syllables, or the second and fourth syllabic stresses, with
downbeat placement, as shown in [Example 7](#ex-7). The second
is the *ottonario* with midpoint caesura; this distributes the syllables
much like the pure *ottonario* but inserts a rest after the first two
poetic feet, as shown in [Example 7](#ex-7). A third profile,
which aligns the first and third syllabic stresses with downbeats and
uses an agogic accent for the first, is shown in [Example 7c](#ex-7c). Finally, there is the profile that aligns each
syllabic stress with a downbeat, as shown in [Example 7d](#ex-7d). This profile saturates the numbers of the
*Entführung* in which Mozart deploys the *alla turca* style (heavy
downbeat emphasis being an important feature thereof). There are other
profiles in the aria, of course, and moments in which textual stress and
musical stress do not align; Mozart's dramaturgic setting of "mich" in
mm. 27 and 29, as described above, is the most salient of these. But
taken as a whole, Mozart's text-setting throughout Rotations 1 and 2 can
only be described as accommodating syllabic weights with commensurate
rhythmic emphases using a typical variety of conventional rhythmic
profiles of the day.

It is, then, quite obvious when the association of textual and musical
stress becomes less strict at the onset of the first coda, notably the
place where Osmin begins to issue his first threats. The fifth stanza
outfits this section; to begin, Osmin offers it in full over the tonic
(mm. 126--130) and then repeats it over the dominant (mm. 130--134).
Throughout both presentations, Mozart sets the first strong syllable of
each line on the weak second beat of the measure and places it a fifth
or an octave higher than the repeated Fs and Cs with which Osmin
delivers the ensuing syllables. [Example 8](#ex-8) provides the
first two textual lines set in this manner. In receiving both textual
and melodic emphases, the weak second beats become a source of
volatility that makes the whole passage feel slightly off-kilter despite
the unwavering harmonic stability and Osmin's otherwise mechanical
declamation. If it is in the second coda that his rage boils over, then
surely it begins to simmer here.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='32' footnote_text=page.footnote_32%}

<h2>Osmin's Triumph</h2>

Osmin offers his exuberant victory aria "O! wie will ich triumphieren"
after his minions catch the Western captives escaping from the palace
near the end of Act 3. The delight and anger roused within him by the
capture are inextricable; his text, provided in [Example 9a](#ex-9a), is in one line gleeful and in the next combative.
Although satisfied at last by the detention of Pedrillo and Belmonte, he
cannot suppress his violent resentment that *Haremsmäuse* like them
exist at all.

I read the aria's form, which is outlined in [Example 9b](#ex-9b), as a modified version of the symmetrical seven-part
rondo identified by Hepokoski-Darcy (2006, 402--4). Their abstract
three-and-a-half rotation model outlines "an AB--AC--AB′--A design, in
which episode 3 (B′) is a tonic transposition of the off-tonic episode 1
(B)" (2006, 402). This allows Rotation 3 to provide a tonal resolution
analogous to that secured by the recapitulatory space of a sonata form.
(We cannot go so far as to call the aria's form a sonata-rondo \[or a
Type 4 in Sonata Theory], since it does not contain the requisite
transition between A and B in the first rotation.){% include footnote.html footnote_number='33' footnote_text=page.footnote_33%} Example 9b makes
more of a distinction between episodes 1 and 3 than the abstract model,
however. These episodes are very closely related: they set the same text
and are melodically analogous between mm. 50--72 (episode 1) and
169--190 (episode 3). I have chosen to label them B and D (rather than B
and B′) because they start with different music, Osmin opting for a
syllabic setting to begin B and a melismatic bravura setting to begin D.
Such virtuosic display at the end of a major character's final aria
would have been expected by both singer and audience in 1782 and, for
me, does not preclude reading the form as a symmetrical seven-part
rondo: episode 3 reproduces much of episode 1 and supplies Rotation 3
with tonal resolution. That being said, this analysis is primarily
concerned with the refrain and episode 2, both of which are marked by
metric and phrase-structural turbulence.

An irrepressible, maniacal glee brims every refrain as Osmin envisages
the new prisoners at the scaffold. Mozart writes three variants of the
refrain, but we will begin with that labeled A in Example 9b, the
hypermeter and vocal phrase structure of which is provided in [Example 10](#ex-10). The section opens with two triple hypermeasures (the
outer constituent measures of which are strong and the middle weak) made
up of two vocal phrases of equal lengths. The third vocal phrase is also
three measures long (mm. 26--28) and initially suggests another triple
hypermeasure, but Osmin's phrase extension via textual fragmentation
("schnüren zu," mm. 28--29) renders mm. 26--29 a quadruple
hypermeasure.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='34' footnote_text=page.footnote_34%} Three statements of this phrase and extension (the
orchestra supplying the expected melody when Osmin drops out in mm.
34--35) subsequently project three quadruple hypermeasures across mm.
30--41. That the triple hypermeter would normalize to a quadruple
pattern is perhaps expected; as Rothstein writes, "when a piece begins
in a non-duple meter, it commonly reverts to duple hypermeter later on,
as if to emphasize that its beginning was metrically abnormal" (1989,
39).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='35' footnote_text=page.footnote_35%}

What should we make of this only-in-hindsight abnormality? Mozart again
seems to call upon that now-familiar paradigm of a passionate man losing
himself in the throes of expressive abandon. If, in "Solche hergelauf'ne
Laffen," Osmin experiences a "towering rage" (to borrow Mozart's words),
then here he is similarly overwhelmed by a towering joy. The giddying
effect of his long-sought victory consumes him, and the initially
irregular metric packaging of his line is symptomatic of his
unrestrained emotional response. Perhaps, then, it is not only when
Osmin becomes enraged, but rather when he is overcome by *any* strong
feeling that he "forgets" his sense of self and (musical) syntax.

Much like the primary theme and transition of "Solche hergelauf'ne
Laffen" return to wreak phrasal havoc in that aria's second rotation,
variants of the refrain return to compromise the metric stability of "O!
wie will ich triumphieren." The refrains labeled A′ in Example 9b are
comprised exactly of mm. 20--33 of A, and the closing A′′ begins with
the first three hypermeasures and vocal phrases of A before continuing
with modified melodic material in a quadruple hypermeter.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='36' footnote_text=page.footnote_36%} Every
presentation of the refrain thus introduces and corrects a triple
hypermeter, providing a cyclic reminder of Osmin's exultation and the
intemperance with which he savors it.

Osmin's jaunty demeanor in the refrain yields to a more characteristic
surliness in episode 2, throughout which he issues his final threats to
Belmonte, Pedrillo, and any other *Haremsmäuse* like them who may plot a
furtive slip through the palace gates. Distrust and indignation thus
reside at the heart of the aria just as they do in the heart of the man,
and Mozart seizes one last opportunity to depict Osmin's maniacal
hostility with a variable vocal phrase structure. Atop the regular
quadruple hypermeter that furnishes the entire episode---and which is
made easily perceptible by the orchestra and harmonic plan---Osmin
superimposes vocal phrases of changing lengths that begin and/or end in
conflict with every hypermeasure.

[Example 11](#ex-11) provides episode 2 in full; through its
first nine measures, the strings project a quadruple hypermeter by
articulating in strong measures and resolving in weak ones. To begin,
the second violins, violas, cellos, and basses offer stepwise descending
half notes tied over every other bar line, marking each metrically
strong measure with the articulation of a half-note pair throughout mm.
87--94.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='37' footnote_text=page.footnote_37%} Against their descent, beginning in m. 89, the first
violins issue a lazily sinking 7--6 suspension series in two-measure
increments that places every resolution in a metrically weak measure.
The passage ends with the arrival of G minor in m. 95; functioning as ii
of F, the harmony initiates a modulation to that key that will occupy
the music through m. 111 (but more on that later).

One could argue that Osmin supports the regular alternation of strong
and weak measures with his pendular melody throughout mm. 87--95, his
lower swoops lending a weightiness to the strong measures and his higher
reaches lending a buoyancy to the weak ones. But this is a superficial
support undercut by his eschewal of the orchestra's explicit
four-measure groupings. He begins with a five-measure phrase (mm.
87--91) that violates the outer boundary of the episode's first
hypermeasure by spilling into the second and continues with a
four-measure phrase (mm. 92--95) similarly offset from the hypermeasures
beneath it. This creates two obfuscating tensions. First, Osmin finishes
both of these phrases in the initial strong measure of a new
hypermeasure, inducing a sense of closure where metric momentum begins
anew. Second, Osmin's second phrase begins in the weak second measure of
the hypermeasure, imposing a starting point where a metric current is
already in motion. Moreover, the unequal lengths of these phrases
asymmetrically dispose the rhyme scheme of the text. Although the
rhyming line-endings of the stanza's first two lines, "leise" and
"*-*mäuse," make for a clumsy rhyme, it is one the listener can
anticipate given that the two preceding stanzas (set in A and B
respectively, as shown in Example 9b) began with two rhyming lines (see
Example 9a). Mozart correlates the phrasal and metric positions of
"leise" and "*-*mäuse" by situating each in the final measure of a vocal
phrase and in the first measure of a hypermeasure (mm. 91, 95), but he
also catches the listener off guard by placing "*-*mäuse" one measure
earlier than expected, the second phrase falling one measure short of
the first's five-measure precedent. (This imbalance is accomplished by
allowing the weak syllable "nur" of the first textual line and vocal
phrase to occupy an entire measure \[m. 88] rather than relegating it
to an eighth note of a dotted-quarter and eighth-note pairing, as Mozart
subsequently treats weak syllables through m. 94.)

The opening nine measures of episode 2 pass as a slow-motion reel,
Osmin's every word and melodic undulation sprawled across each measure
in unavoidable contrast with the preceding declamatory bustle of the
refrain. The passage conjures the delicate, creeping movements with
which Osmin alleges the *Haremsmäuse* will attempt to surreptitiously
enter the palace. But the bobbing melody and artificially slower tempo
(resulting from the *tutti* rhythmic augmentation) also engender a lull
that helps to enhance the shock value of Osmin's next eruption: in m.
96, Osmin jolts up the interval of a tenth over a *tutti* downbeat
***fp*** as the orchestra likewise shifts registers and the violins swap
their languorous half notes for agitated sixteenths (see Example 11).
The outburst is made all the more unpredictable by its placement in the
weak second measure of the hypermeasure.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='38' footnote_text=page.footnote_38%} Osmin continues in a
formidable melodic unison with the orchestra to warn the foolhardy harem
mice in the ensuing phrase of mm. 96--99 ("Unser Ohr entdeckt euch
schon") and concludes at the start of a new hypermeasure over the
dominant of F (m. 99).

In no other moment across Osmin's solo offerings does the music assume
such a narrative function as in the opening of episode 2, where the
vocal phrase structure, text-setting, and harmonic plan combine to enact
the cat-and-mouse pursuit evoked by the text. Osmin's cat first lies in
wait across mm. 87--95, the languid suspensions, metrically tensional
phrase structure, and premature rhyme conclusion indicating to the more
discerning *Haremsmaus* that this is a false calm. Duly poised, the cat
then pounces on his victim mouse in the vulnerably weak m. 96 with a
registral leap, dynamic contrast, and the imposing melodic shadow of the
orchestra. The arrival of the dominant seventh of F in m. 99 signals the
cat's victory by setting the first clear harmonic goal of the episode.
And as the cat sings through m. 111 about the just punishment the
prisoner mouse will suffer, the music moves to and cadences in F (mm.
110--111), thereby underpinning the cat's triumph with a harmonic
stability that was not present during his chase.

Backtracking a bit in Example 11, we should note that Osmin remains out
of step with the hypermeter as he takes his modulating victory lap in
mm. 99--111. He begins three phrases on the upbeats to weak second
measures (mm. 99, 101, 103) and consistently concludes his phrases in
strong measures (either the first or third of the hypermeasures) through
the cadence of m. 111. This is, perhaps, like the ebullient and
metrically uneven refrain, another example of Osmin losing his emotional
and musical composure in the fervency of his joy. The delight he derives
from his role as captor---both of Belmonte and Pedrillo and in his
cat-and-mouse fantasy---simply overwhelms him.

Osmin repeats the "Schleicht nur" passage of mm. 87--99 in mm. 115--127
(see Example 11).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='39' footnote_text=page.footnote_39%} The repetition diverges from its model in m. 127
(analogous to m. 99) as Osmin lingers on the textual fragment "entdeckt
euch schon" through m. 131. He concludes in what initially sounds like
the first measure of a new hypermeasure (m. 131), but Mozart writes a
fermata above the *tutti* half note to force a pause on the dominant of
D. The prolongation subsumes the remaining three measures of the
hypermeasure and (temporarily) suspends the hypermeter, since no matter
how modestly or generously the singer interprets the fermata, there are
no pulses to mark the time. It is like a bolt from the blue, then, that
the refrain returns in m. 132 with its startling downbeat exclamation
and boisterous rhythms. The cat has pounced again.

<span style="font-family: music; text-align: center; font-size: 10rem;">&#xE4C6;</span>

In the letter quoted at the outset of this article, Mozart wrote of a
man whose rage causes him to overstep "all the bounds of order,
moderation, and propriety." Mozart used this description to justify the
double coda of "Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen," but in doing so he also
suggested broader truths about Osmin's character and the way his
emotional expressivity might manifest musically. The inconsistent vocal
phrase structures, hypermetric deferrals, and misalignment of musical
and syllabic stresses in "Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen" represent the
debilitating effects of Osmin's rage before that rage becomes
all-consuming in the second coda. The recurring hypermetric correction
of the "O! wie will ich triumphieren" refrain lends tumult to an unusual
victory speech, demonstrating that any emotion Osmin experiences
strongly can compromise his mental and musical coherence. And the
friction between the hypermeter and vocal phrase structure in that
aria's episode 2 helps to musically narrate Osmin's deeply vindictive
fantasy of ensnaring those men he dislikes. Through irregularities of
phrase structure, hypermeter, and text-setting, Mozart developed an
idiosyncratic metric language that could suit the haywire expression of
an indignant man whose emotions often get the better of him.

Although Osmin's ensembles are beyond the scope of this essay, the
finale of Act 3 provides a revealing moment with which to conclude our
discussion of his music. We are not concerned with the finale's
quotation of "Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen"---in both the aria and the
finale, that famous passage projects regular duple-based phrases and
hypermeter---but rather with Osmin's entry into the ensemble.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='40' footnote_text=page.footnote_40%}

The finale is a tuneful vaudeville in F major. To begin, each Western
protagonist offers the Pasha a celebratory verse that concludes with a
*tutti* refrain in which Osmin---who is usually staged seething in the
corner---also reluctantly takes part. Blonde, the Englishwoman whom
Osmin has romantically pursued for the last three acts, is the last of
the Europeans to sing.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='41' footnote_text=page.footnote_41%} As shown in [Example 12](#ex-12),
she concludes her verse by pointing to Osmin and asking the Pasha
whether anyone should be expected to "endure" such an "animal" (mm.
61--65). The question is too injurious for Osmin to ignore, and at last
he enters in m. 64 with his own (melodically modified) verse, preventing
the expected presentation of the refrain and reinterpreting the final
weak measure of Blonde's phrase.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='42' footnote_text=page.footnote_42%} Mozart even marks a double bar
halfway through m. 64, visually separating Osmin's contribution from the
rest.

It is a briefly humanizing moment for the dour caretaker. Osmin had
remained silent through all the others' rapturous verses---even that
delivered by his nemesis, Pedrillo, at whom he leveled "Solche
hergelauf'ne Laffen" in the first act. It is Blonde's jab that lures
Osmin into the fray, her public rejection so hurtful that he cannot wait
even one measure to respect the metric order and defend himself. One
wonders if perhaps it is not only the presence of the *Laffen* and
*Haremsmäuse* that cause Osmin so much grief, but also the absence of a
*Liebchen*---which, unlike the men he cautions in his first aria, he has
not yet found for himself.
