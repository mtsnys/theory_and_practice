{% capture footnote_4 %} The latter argument builds on Reale's (2015) Society for Music Theory presentation, summarizing and strengthening his memorable argument that the "transformational attitude" presented in Lewin (1983) is ideally suited for analyzing videogame music. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_5 %} Such sound effects were almost always *synthesized* as tones rather than being played back from sound recordings; the Nintendo Entertainment System's (NES) capacity for samples was very limited, meaning that most NES sound effects have a pitch profile and some (such as collecting coins or pausing the game in *Super Mario Bros.*) have identifiable interval content. See Altice (2015, 249--288) for more on the technical capabilities of the NES. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_6 %} Though publishers may simply be trying to save pages of back matter (and thus production costs), I would argue that books and essay collections minimizing their scholarly apparatus is also an accessibility issue: where might a new reader look if they wish to know more, if not to footnotes, endnotes, or bibliographies? Minimizing citations all too often serves as accidental gatekeeping, separating new readers from the deeper context that might contribute to their understanding. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_7 %} Among the most significant non-musical game studies texts discussed within the body of the book but not included in the Bibliography are Kocurek (2015), Consalvo (2016), Calleja (2011), and Aarseth (1997). {% endcapture %}
