{% capture footnote_1 %} Indeed, all have published at least one monograph and multiple articles that engage predominantly with nineteenth-century music since 2011: for example, Horton (2015, 2017, and 2022); Hyland (2016 and 2023); Schmalfeldt (2011); Taylor (2011 and 2021); Vande Moortele (2017 and 2021). {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_2 %} My contributions to the new *Formenlehre* include Martinkus (2017, 2018, 2021). {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_3 %} For more on issues that arise in applying theories of Classical form to the analysis of Romantic music, see Horton (2017). {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_4 %} With regards to Romantic form, Horton, Taylor, and Vande Moortele---through their ongoing corpus study, "Theorizing Sonata Form in European Concert Music, 1815­--1914"---aim to develop a more nuanced understanding of sonata-form composition in the nineteenth century through analyses of ca. 1300 pieces, including works both canonic and otherwise. As an external collaborator, I have found it gratifying to center composers and pieces previously underrepresented in the discourse. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_5 %} There is also a companion website, which is a fantastic resource filled with annotated scores and links to recordings. However, it can be somewhat disappointing when links to recordings no longer work (e.g., examples 7.3f, 7.3k) or measures are missing (e.g., 7.3d). {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_6 %} It is clear from Danuta Mirka's review that she disagrees with some of Burstein's interpretations of Koch's theory. For example, she takes issue with Burstein's explication of the distinction between a *Grundabsatz*, *Cadenz*, and *förmliche Cadenz* (Mirka 2022, 273­--79). However, if read in conjunction with Koch, exploring these different interpretations of historical writings could be a useful pedagogical exercise. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_7 %} In the text, Burstein comingles the Kochian language of various *Sätze* with modern terminology drawn from Hepokoski and Darcy's sonata theory (e.g., "medial caesura" and "secondary theme"). My use of the term "subordinate key" here conveys my alignment with the form-functional analytical perspective of William Caplin (Caplin 1998). This analytical attitude certainly influenced my engagement with Burstein's analyses, especially the extent to which I am able to hear or privilege the punctuation sequence in my own listening. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_8 %} Burstein acknowledges this possibility---that the overlay of modern terms will vary from piece to piece even though the punctuation sequence is shared---at the beginning of chapter 7. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_9 %} I offer select examples of the different grouping structures that arise, but there are certainly more. For example, sometimes the *Quintabsatz* and *Quintabsatz in V* group together, as in 7.3e (Domenic Alberti, Sonata for Keyboard in F Major, op. 1 no. 2, first movement). Further excavation of how *Absätze* group and how this impacts the resulting expositional layout would be an interesting line of inquiry, building on Burstein's work. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_10 %} However, there are instances where, while the distinction between transition and subordinate theme is blurry, a "distinction" (or functional lack thereof) can be drawn if one attends to intrinsic functions within formal units. For example, in 7.3p (Joseph Haydn, Symphony no. 1 in D Major, third movement), I hazard to guess that Burstein would call the boundary between TR and ST hard to distinguish. He identifies the end of the *Quintabsatz* in m. 15, eliding with a *Schlusssatz* comprising mm. 15­­--21. I hear this passage as indicative of transition/subordinate theme fusion: what could have been a standing on the dominant in mm. 15ff, clearly marking the end of the transition, instead initiates a continuation phrase leading to a V: PAC in m. 21 (fusing transition and subordinate theme function, with no clear beginning to the subordinate theme and in retrospect undermining the end of the transition; this entire unit is followed by subordinate theme 2 in mm. 21­--32). For more on the concept of transition/subordinate theme fusion, see Caplin and Martin (2016). {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_11 %} While in the abstract, Burstein's parsing makes sense, it does not account for all possible interpretations (especially situations with transition/subordinate theme fusion, as discussed in note 10, which seem to be relatively common in this repertoire). {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_12 %} There are two distinct corpora represented in the book. The first, pertaining directly to sonata form, are the 732 pieces written between 1656--1769; findings from the analysis of this corpus are covered in chapters 4--6. The second corpus comprises 240 concerto movements composed between 1720--1790, and these are addressed in chapter 7. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_13 %} Greenberg engages relatively minimally with the literature on memes; future work, building on this study, could investigate the relationship between cultural context and the medial repeat, double return, and end rhyme. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_14 %} For more details of the corpus, such as the works included (listed alphabetically and chronologically), the ratio of works to composers, and distribution of composers by decade, one can consult the appendices and companion website. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_15 %} For example, in Greenberg's corpus the medial repeat peaks in the 1740s and declines through the 1760s. Yet it isn't until 1739---close to the peak---that the medial repeat is explicitly mentioned in a theoretical text. By 1793, though other options for beginning the second part are discussed, the medial repeat it is still positioned as the "first-level default" (69). By 1796 the medial repeat "is considered tedious and outdated" (71), well after it had started to fall out of favor compositionally. The relationship between roughly contemporaneous theory and practice stands in stark juxtaposition to modern theories of form, where the medial repeat is listed as one of multiple ways to initiate the development section. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_16 %} Through his discussion of the recapitulation's emergence in the late eighteenth century, Greenberg calls attention to the misattribution of terms like "false recapitulation" and "secondary development" when used in the analysis of such Galant sonata forms: doing so frames normative practices ca. 1740 as deviations from a norm that didn't arise until much later. This stance affirms the work of other eighteenth-century scholars (e.g., Neuwirth 2013, Burstein 2020), and highlights the issues that arise when using a model derived from the high Classical style to analyze Galant music. {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_17 %} For more on "positive" versus "negative" approaches to analyzing nineteenth-century form see Vande Moortele (2013, 408). {% endcapture %}
{% capture footnote_18 %} For the reader wary of engaging with a potentially math-laden text, it is worth noting that Greenberg does a nice job of commingling the explication of mathematical components/statistical method with digestible descriptions of the results---including the occasional note telling the less math-inclined what to skip. {% endcapture %}

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

Two monographs delving into eighteenth-century sonata forms---L. Poundie
Burstein's *Journeys Through Galant Expositions* and Yoel Greenberg's
*How Sonata Forms: A Bottom-Up Approach to Musical Form*---arrive at a
time when the majority of new *Formenlehre* discourse centers Romantic
form. This is due, in no small part, to the fact that many of the
prominent analysts of musical form today are preoccupied with the long
nineteenth century: Julian Horton, Anne Hyland, Janet Schmalfeldt,
Benedict Taylor, and Steven Vande Moortele, for example, are primarily
concerned with excavating formal processes in music composed during this
period.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='1' footnote_text=footnote_1%} While my own work has largely been situated in the
nineteenth century and in dialogue with the work of the aforementioned
scholars, I found it refreshing to engage with new (to me) repertoire,
much of which predates the advent of a textbook "sonata form," through
Burstein's and Greenberg's analyses.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='2' footnote_text=footnote_2%} Moreover, I felt a kinship with
these scholars of the eighteenth century as they reckoned with the
awkward fit between contemporary theories of form and historical
practice.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='3' footnote_text=footnote_3%}

In their respective studies, Burstein and Greenberg engage with a large
swath of repertoire. In so doing, they implicitly communicate the value
of moving beyond the canon---a trend echoed in both scholarship of
Romantic form, specifically, and in the discipline of music theory, more
broadly.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='4' footnote_text=footnote_4%} Ultimately, these monographs complement one another quite
well: their approach to framing and interpreting analyses paints a more
comprehensive picture of compositional thought and practice in the
eighteenth century than perhaps either book achieves alone. In what
follows, I consider each work in turn and close by placing the two texts
in dialogue, considering how these studies impact future contributions
to the new *Formenlehre*.

<h2 id="journeys">Journeys Through Galant Expositions</h2>

Burstein's monograph focuses on Galant sonata forms which, for him,
means pieces composed between 1750 and 1780 (11). The book has two
large-scale parts: chapters 1­--6 introduce the reader to historical
terms and analytical methods through a thorough review of the writings
of multiple eighteenth-century theorists (e.g., Koch, Galeazzi, Kollman,
and Neubauer), placing these theories in dialogue with modern
terminology, while chapters 7­--15 demonstrate theoretical concepts via
detailed analysis.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='5' footnote_text=footnote_5%} As a primer on theories of form in the eighteenth
century---and an especially deep dive into Koch's formal theory---the
first half of this text, and the glossary included in Appendix II, could
slot well into any history of theory course.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='6' footnote_text=footnote_6%} For analysts of
eighteenth-century sonata forms, the standard punctuation sequence,
which is formally introduced in chapter 7 and summarized here in
[Example 1](#ex_1) presents a useful heuristic for
understanding the construction of Galant expositions.

{% include figure_grid.html columns=1 figure_key='figure_1' %}


Chapter 7 lays the framework for the analyses of expositions presented
in chapters 8­­--13. Chapter 8 illustrates what modern theorists might
consider standard, two-part expositions with clearly defined "zones"
(136); chapters 9­--13 explore different ways of dividing the exposition
into two or three parts; and chapters 14­--15 look beyond expositions to
the last two *Theile* and full movements, respectively. Throughout
chapters 7--13, the punctuation sequence is Burstein's primary
analytical tool. Each exposition analyzed is parsed into "legs" on their
respective journeys to resting points on I, V, V of the subordinate key,
and a final PAC in the subordinate key.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='7' footnote_text=footnote_7%} For Burstein, the benefits
of the punctuation sequence stem not only from its seemingly ubiquitous
presence in Galant expositions, but also from its ability to cleanly
capture motion towards harmonic goals without incurring the baggage
associated with modern terminology. The first two examples in chapter 7,
and the subsequent form charts provided in ex. 7.3, all serve to
illustrate "the underlying punctuation sequence" which is "very vivid"
(127). Burstein contrasts this clear articulation of the punctuation
sequence with the difficulty one might encounter when approaching these
works from a modern perspective: "what is not easy to determine for the
expositions cited in Ex. 7.3, however . . . are the locations---even in
an approximate, general sense---of the transition vs. a secondary theme
group, or which of the half-cadential breaks should be labeled as the
medial caesura" (127).

Each form chart in ex. 7.3 offers an overview of the exposition,
aligning groups (delineated by measure numbers) with their location in
the punctuation sequence. From listening to these examples, my overall
impression is that the punctuation sequence offers a way of listening
for arrivals that helps parse formal units. Moreover, I am intrigued by
the different grouping structures that result from articulating the same
punctuation sequence.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='8' footnote_text=footnote_8%} For example, in the case of 7.3d (Antonio
Brioschi, Symphony in G Major, op. 2 no. 59, first movement) the
*Grundabsatz* feels self-contained---likely due to the sol-do motion in
the bass in mm. 3­--4 and the subsequent closing section rhetoric that
follows (see [Example 2](#ex-2)). At other times, I find myself
hearing arrivals in the *Grundabsatz* as subordinate to subsequent
cadential articulations at the end of the *Quintabsatz*, creating one
larger unit. For instance, in 7.3g (Anna Amalia of Prussia, Sonata for
Flute and Continuo in F Major, third movement) I hear the *Grundabsatz*
and *Quintabsatz* grouping together, forming a main theme (cbi +
continuation) that ends with a half cadence (see [Example 3](#ex-3)).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='9' footnote_text=footnote_9%}

{% include figure_grid.html columns=1 figure_key='figure_2' %}


{% include figure_grid.html columns=1 figure_key='figure_3' %}


As indicated by the title, in *Journeys Through Galant Expositions*
Burstein urges the reader and future analyst to think of formal sections
as goal-directed units, motivated by the motion from a starting point
towards a specific harmonic goal. Burstein juxtaposes this journey
metaphor with the predominant "container" model of form (5­--10) and
demonstrates through multiple analyses that while the "outlines of
distinct first theme, transition, and secondary theme sections" may be
"murky," the punctuation sequence underpinning the construction of many
Galant expositions is "unambiguous" (123). This theme---the thorny
relationship between contemporary models of form and pieces written in
the Galant style---runs throughout the text.

Throughout the analytical chapters, Burstein routinely highlights how
Galant expositions thwart facile classification using the terminology of
contemporary formal units (especially the distinction between transition
and subordinate theme).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='10' footnote_text=footnote_10%} Much of this is due, in Burstein's view, to
the fact that analysts today simply approach sonata form from a
different perspective than Koch et al.: thematic character does not seem
to play a large role in theorizing sectional divisions within Galant
expositions, and eighteenth-century theorists were more concerned with
tonal motion and melodic/harmonic goals than with key areas writ large
(87). This can result in two drastically different conceptualizations
of, for instance, the division of an exposition into two parts. In an
exposition with a modulating transition, as shown in his ex. 4.10,
Burstein suggests that what contemporary theorists would call the
transition + subordinate theme, Koch would group together in the second
half. This stands in stark contrast to a contemporary parsing, in which
the transition (by dint of being a transition)---regardless of the key
in which it cadences---belongs to the first half of the exposition
(76).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='11' footnote_text=footnote_11%}

The discomfort conveyed in Burstein's prose, describing his experience
applying modern terminology, is not relegated to the analysis of Galant
sonata forms. I recently encountered a piece by Helene Liebmann (Grand
Piano Sonata in C Minor, op. 3, first movement), published in 1811, that
does not "play nice" with contemporary formal labels. This is not to say
that you cannot make sense of it through a modern lens. However, the
parallels between Liebmann's piece and the standard punctuation sequence
struck me: considering the cadences that end large-scale units, we find
arrivals on V -- V/III -- I/III (x2), suggesting perhaps a deeper-level
connection to eighteenth-century models of punctuation form. All of this
to say, while readers (such as myself) may initially have difficulty
hearing genuine points of arrival within the punctuation sequence, it
offers another productive mode of listening to pieces from the Galant
era and beyond.

<h2 id='how-sonata-forms'>How Sonata Forms</h2>

The title of Greenberg's monograph, much like Burstein's, is apropos.
Interested quite literally in how sonata form came to be, Greenberg
derives a bottom-up theory of sonata form from a corpus of 732 works
composed between 1656--1769, drawing parallels between the evolution of
genes and musical form.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='12' footnote_text=footnote_12%} For Greenberg, the medial repeat, double
return, and end rhyme are musical/cultural phenomena that, through
replication, coalesced into one of the most significant musical-cultural
artifacts of the eighteenth century: sonata form. Of note, the double
return and end rhyme were more successful at replication in the long run
than the medial repeat. Unlike Burstein's monograph, this book is less
about presenting an historical perspective to new readership (although
Greenberg does engage with eighteenth-century theorists at times), and
more about rethinking our relationship to sonata form as analysts. That
is, Greenberg aims to shed new light on the ontological status of the
thing itself.

Chapters 1­--2 review multiple twentieth-century theorizations of sonata
form, such as Ratner (1980), Rosen (1980), Caplin (1998), and Hepokoski
and Darcy (2006). Two threads emerge in these opening chapters that set
the stage for the remainder of the text. The first concerns fundamental
stumbling blocks Greenberg identifies in modern theorizations of sonata
form. He refers to these as the synchronic and diachronic problems---for
Greenberg, "sonata form is thus the victim of a twofold fuzziness:
synchronic fuzziness in our inability to clearly define and delineate
it, and diachronic fuzziness in our inability to agree on its advent"
(23). The second thread excavates the relationship between parts and
wholes, and the general tendency in theorizing to privilege the whole:
"we engage with a sonata form without a second theme in the dominant,
without a recapitulated second theme, or without a double return as we
would engage with a headless man: we must either explain why the part
has gone missing or else . . . provide the whole with an entirely
different categorization" (37). This monograph aims to solve these
problems, theorizing from a position that not only appeals to both
synchronic and diachronic concerns, but also works "bottom up" to
prioritize parts over wholes.

Chapter 3 introduces the lens of evolutionary biology, and Greenberg
situates his bottom-up theory of musical form in within the
mid-twentieth-century turn towards a gene-centered theory of natural
selection. From a biological perspective, the gene becomes the primary
unit of natural selection; humans, animals, and plants are "survival
machines" for genes. Thus, sonata form becomes the "survival machine"
for independent elements found within (the specific elements are
introduced in chapter 4). In both cases, the success of a mutation is
measured in statistical terms. Couching his theory of form in terms of
evolution, Greenberg appeals frequently to Richard Dawkins's work,
particularly his contributions to reorienting the evolutionary narrative
around genes rather than organisms. Notably, Dawkins's work on the
emergence and replication of cultural phenomena (memes) offers a strong
grounding for the parallelism Greenberg draws between the evolution,
through imitation, of a cultural artifact (sonata form) and the gene's
capacity to propagate (Dawkins 1976, 249).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='13' footnote_text=footnote_13%}

Chapter 4 gets to the heart of Greenberg's theory, detailing the current
"genes" under consideration: the medial repeat, the double return, and
the end rhyme. Summarized here are the analyses of 732 movements
composed between 1656--1769 containing binary repeat signs, set in
moderate to fast tempi, by eighty-four composers born and active in
Germany, Austria, and Italy (67).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='14' footnote_text=footnote_14%} Greenberg concludes that the
three aforementioned elements are statistically independent and become
more popular over time, supporting his theory of sonata form as an
emergent phenomenon. Throughout the chapter Greenberg places his data in
dialogue with eighteenth-century theories of sonata form, illustrating a
closer relationship between theory and practice in historical compared
to modern theories of form.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='15' footnote_text=footnote_15%} The narrative presented in this chapter
(through data) is convincing---that is, it seems reasonable that what we
think of as sonata form arose from a confluence of events and had been
around for some time before earning its own name, distinct from other
binary or ternary forms.

Chapters 5­ and 6 center positive and negative interactions,
respectively. Positive interactions occur when two items together are
better than they are alone; being paired thus "increases their survival
fitness" and leads to a common practice in the realm of musical form
(97). Negative interactions occur when two elements compete or
contradict one another; in these situations, one element will prevail
over the other (116). Chapter 5 is concerned with timelines;
specifically, Greenberg uses data to tease apart when a piece that looks
like a sonata form is best understood to have arisen out of chance as
opposed to belonging to sonata form as a formal category. He considers
two structures: those with a "binary rotation"---referred to as a type 2
sonata by Hepokoski and Darcy (2006, 353--87)---and those with
recapitulatory rotations, or type 3 sonata forms (Hepokoski and Darcy
2006, 344). Greenberg first explains the rise of the binary rotation,
locating its "emergence . . . as a unified, higher-martinkusarchy phenomenon"
in the 1720s and 1730s, when the medial repeat and end rhyme occurred
frequently together and requoted increasingly more material (100).
Following the data, the recapitulatory rotation (as a unit in-and-of
itself) emerged between 1740 and 1760. Through a comparison of two
keyboard sonatas by C. P. E. Bach, one from 1744 (Sonata in C Major, Wq.
62 no. 7), the other from 1757 (Sonata in B<span style="font-family: music;">&#x266D;</span> Major, Wq. 62 no. 16),
Greenberg illustrates this emergence. The double return in the C Major
Sonata is followed by nearly twenty measures not explained vis-à-vis
rotational logic before realigning with the exposition, while the B<span style="font-family: music;">&#x266D;</span>
Major Sonata's "post double-return space" is clearly a recapitulatory
rotation.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='16' footnote_text=footnote_16%} Chapter 6 illustrates combinations of elements that did
not coalesce into a higher-level formal unit. Specifically, Greenberg
addresses how composers avoided an abundance of repetition while
employing both a medial repeat and double return. While the double
return was to become the primary marker of sonata form (eclipsing the
early prominence of the medial repeat), this chapter explores
compositional solutions to using both a medial repeat and a double
return, presented in order from more "binary-oriented structures to
ternary-oriented ones" (120). Taken together, these two chapters
showcase the dynamic, processual (or, in Greenberg's terms, emergent or
evolutionary) nature of form.

Chapters 7 and 8 move beyond sonata form proper. Chapter 7 tackles the
concerto, using data from a similarly large corpus (250 works composed
between 1720­--1790) to illustrate the transition from a structure based
on the alternation of opposing textures (tutti versus solo) to a more
sonata-like structure resulting from the form's gradual expansion
accompanied by a shift in agency away from orchestral tutti to the solo
instrument. Tracing the same three "genes"---medial repeat, double
return, and end rhyme---Greenberg illustrates the convergence of sonata
and concerto form over the course of the eighteenth century. Chapter 8
concludes the monograph, summarizing Greenberg's contribution to
unpacking the emergence of sonata form (pp. 184­--185, especially),
suggesting paths of future study (adopting the genealogical model to
study other forms, such as fugue), reinforcing the fuzziness of
categories, and reminding the reader how much our analytical models
influence the way we think.

Throughout the book, there is ample critique of twentieth-century
theories of form and of how contemporary theorists approach formal
analysis. These critiques stem from the belief that modern theorists are
overly reliant on one model of sonata form that is too narrow. Greenberg
is by no means alone in this regard. Indeed, the desire for a theory of
Romantic form stems from a similar concern to escape the inherent
"negative" theorizing that occurs when comparing individual works
against abstract formal models (especially models derived from music
composed in a limited time period).{% include footnote.html footnote_number='17' footnote_text=footnote_17%} Greenberg offers a different
way to think about how sonata form came to be, and he makes the
convincing argument that analysts would do well to think about the
context of a piece before engaging in a norms-versus-deformations
dialogue. It bears mentioning, however, that Greenberg's bottom-up
theory is not an analytical tool, which might leave the reader who is
hoping to duplicate some of Greenberg's analyses with questions. For
example, I would have appreciated more clarity in defining what counts
as a medial repeat or double return: how much material needs to return,
and how loosely related can it be? That said, Greenberg is not
presenting an analytical method; rather, he offers an interpretive
framework for historically contextualizing sonata forms.

<h2 id='from-how'>From How to Now: A Journey Forward</h2>

Read together, *Journeys Through Galant Expositions* and *How Sonata
Forms* offer a robust picture of sonata-form composition in the
mid-eighteenth century, introducing the reader to a great deal of new
repertoire from complementary perspectives. For example, Burstein
focuses primarily on the first part (exposition), while Greenberg
highlights the second part (and how it can support a binary or ternary
structure). Both present findings from analyzing large swaths of music,
moving beyond the typical composers consulted in contemporary theories
of form: Burstein's monograph is invested in reviving an analytical
system for the Galant style and offers the reader a slew of examples to
engage with, while Greenberg takes a more historically oriented tack,
demonstrating how those structures came to be primarily through
statistical analysis.{% include footnote.html footnote_number='18' footnote_text=footnote_18%} These authors both engage with historical
theories of form, but for different reasons: Burstein uses the methods
developed by Koch and others to offer a different framework for
analysts, while Greenberg compares descriptions of sonata form found in
treatises with trends in his data, mapping changes in his findings onto
changes in theoretical discourse.

I suggested in the introduction that these studies can impact future
contributions to the new *Formenlehre* and strongly believe this to be
true. These texts reinvigorate the conversation surrounding form in the
eighteenth-century; future research building on these works could
interrogate the relationship between formal functions and the
punctuation sequence, or adopt Greenberg's genetic model to other formal
types. They also highlight the risks involved when using contemporary
models to analyze historical practice. Burstein reminds us that, while
analytical anachronisms can be valid and useful, our analyses stand to
benefit when we place our models in dialogue with historically
contemporaneous writings. The issue of anachronism manifests in
Greenberg's work as the diachronic problem. Tackling it head-on, as
shown in his text, can enrich analyses and help ensure that, in an
effort to label musical phenomena, analysts do not conflate musical
object with compositional intent. Taken together, these monographs serve
as healthy reminders to analysts that sonata form has never been
monolithic and should not be treated as such.
