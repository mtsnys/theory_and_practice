Theory and Practice is the journal of the Music Theory Society of New York State (MTSNYS), published annually since 1975. The journal has featured a wide range of topics in music theory, including analysis, history, pedagogy, and theoretical approaches to various musical genres and styles, and it has acted as a venue for emerging scholars in the field of music theory through the Society's Patricia Carpenter Emerging Scholar Award.Â  

Article submissions should be sent to emailed to theoryandpractice@mtsnys.org in two file formats, PDF and DOCX. Any large files (e.g., audio examples) should be submitted as links rather than through e-mail. Theory and Practice is digitally archived in JSTOR and ProQuest (including future volumes), and published authors are provided with both a print and PDF version of their article.
