footnote_1: "Even notable exceptions such as Harrison 2016 and Lam 2019 focus on the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth, leaving much room for work on more recent repertoire." 
footnote_2: "Ewazen's popularity partially stems from his emphasis on accessibility for performer and audience, his concern for using each instrument to its best advantage, and his attention to instruments that welcome new repertoire, particularly winds and brass; see Pettit (2003, 34--35) and Brown (2009, 137). While writings on his music include a handful of DMA documents and abundant interviews, analyses of his works have yet to appear in professional music theory venues. This paucity of analyses may partially stem from the fact that, as Ryan Anthony observes, \"[m]uch of Ewazen's music looks easy and less sophisticated than it proves to be\" (Pettit 2003, 38)." 
footnote_3: "HipBoneMusic (2017, 24:00--24:55). For a works list, see the \"Music\" page of Ewazen's website: <https://www.ericewazen.com/themusic.php>." 
footnote_4: "Borrowing Ian Bates' general definition, \"tonality\" in this article denotes \"a scale with identifiable tonic from which melodic and harmonic materials are derived\" (2012, 35, fn 9)." 
footnote_5: "Thus, Ewazen's view of \"tonality\" aligns with Ian Bates' (2012) definition mentioned above. For a summary of the numerous other ways the term has been used over the centuries, see Hyer (2001)." 
footnote_6: "His mother was Polish, and his father was Ukrainian. References to his father's interest in Ukrainian dancing are ubiquitous in Ewazen's interviews, including Brown (2009, 138) and HipBoneMusic (2017, 3:35--4:28)." 
footnote_7: "Ewazen also frequently mentions his teachers as major influences. These include professors Joseph Schwanter, Samuel Adler, Warren Benson, and Eugene Kurtz at Eastman; Gunther Schuller at Tanglewood; and Milton Babbitt at Juilliard. See McNally (2008, 2--10) for a discussion of Ewazen's formative years." 
footnote_8: "Interestingly, Ewazen mentions this when discussing the admiration of Brahms held by Milton Babbitt, one of Ewazen's teachers (HipBoneMusic 2017, 11:33--12:10). Occasionally, the emulation extends past general features. For example, Ewazen consciously modeled his Trio for Trumpet, Violin, and Piano after Brahms' Horn Trio (Altman 2005, 88)." 
footnote_9: "To be fair, not even eighteenth-century works always follow this fuzzy principle, as Hepokoski (2002) illustrates. The point remains that the twentieth and twenty-first centuries illustrate widely divergent ideas of what can constitute a sonata. For instance, Thomas Schmidt-Beste (2011, 157--172) identifies multiple streams in the twentieth century: neo-romanticist, neo-classicist, a return to a \"generic piece for instrument(s),\" and the eclectic sonata. Even each general category envelops divergent features that resist tidy generalizations." 
footnote_10: "For further information on Schubert's approach to sonata form, see Webster (1978)." 
footnote_11: "For a discussion of octatonic passages in Ewazen's Sonata for Trumpet and Piano, see McNally (2008, 37--54)." 
footnote_12: "This serves as a particular example of what Peter Kaminsky (2011, 108) describes as Ravel's penchant for \"*minimal* compositional materials serving in *maximal* formal/structural contexts.\"" 
footnote_13: "Page (1986, 14), as quoted in McNally (2008, 13)." 
footnote_14: "Bates (2012, Examples 9Â­--10, 39). Subsequent charts in this article adopt Bates's practice of indicating a tonality based on a capital letter representing tonic and a subscript letter indicating mode. This requires using Ionian instead of major and Aeolian rather than minor (regardless of the presence of the leading tone)." 
footnote_15: "For Ewazen's account of his early exposure to rock, see Altman (2005, 164--166)." 
footnote_16: "Snedecker (2001, 33) is quoting Ewazen here. For further comments on how Ewazen's wide voicing recalls that of Aaron Copland, see Pettit (2003, 32) and Brown (2009, 138). For a comparison of the opening trumpet lines of Copland's *Quiet City* and Ewazen's *...to cast a shadow again*, see Altman (2005, 23)." 
footnote_17: "Ewazen's Sonata for Trumpet and Piano similarly opens with quartal/quintal harmony (McNally 2008, 19)." 
footnote_18: "Lehman's list (2018, xiv) includes categories such as modal cadence, chromatic cadence, and chromatically modulating cadence." 
footnote_19: "For descriptions of his collaborative process, see Brown (2009, 141--142)." 
footnote_20: "McNally (2008, 7) provides an example from Ewazen's composition lessons: \"While teaching in a contemporary style, Adler would use analysis of traditional scores of Haydn and others to demonstrate compositional structure.\"" 
footnote_21: "These examples adopt the nomenclature and presentation of Bates 2012." 
footnote_22: "Figure 1.5 of Caplin (2009, 38) contains a useful chart summarizing the tight-knit versus loose continuum. For more detailed discussion, see Chapter 8 (\"Subordinate Theme\") and Chapter 9 (\"Transition\") of Caplin (1998)." 
footnote_23: "The first movement of Ewazen's Sonata for Trumpet and Piano similarly develops all themes from the exposition (McNally 2008, 30)." 
footnote_24: "The relationships described in this paragraph could more formally be represented with four types of transformations from Julian Hook (2008, 142). A signature transformation shows sharpwise (s~n~) or flatwise (f~n~) moves around the circle of fifths. Diatonic transposition is indicated via lower case (t~n~), and chromatic transposition is indicated via upper case (T~n~). The motion of the piano part between sections could be described as s~2~t~6~ from exposition to development and s~1~t~6~ from development to recapitulation. The four-note motive moves by t~5~ within the exposition and by T~2~ from the start of the exposition to the start of the development." 
footnote_25: "The first movement of the Sonata for Trumpet and Piano provide a different strategy towards recapitulatory design by combining the tonality and harmonies from the main theme with the rhythmic motive from the subordinate theme (McNally 2008, 33)." 
footnote_26: "Ewazen avoids tonal closure without connoting the negative valance of what Sonata Theory describes as \"failed\" recapitulations (Hepokosi and Darcy 2006, 242--249)." 
footnote_27: "The notations follow common practice: parentheses indicate set classes, angle brackets mark contour segments, and square brackets mark interval vectors. For lists of relevant sources, see Straus (2016, 93--94 and 157)." 
footnote_28: "See chapter 14 of Hepokoski and Darcy (2006, 306--317)." 
footnote_29: "As Altman (2005, 14) notes, \"Ewazen's music deserves to be studied because it has been of great interest to so many performers and listeners.\""
