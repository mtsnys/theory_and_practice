marginnote_1: "I am grateful to Mark Anson-Cartwright, Loretta Terrigno, and Allan W. Atlas for comments and insights that strengthened every draft of this article."
footnote_1: "Important studies among these include Melamed (2010) on the use of Osmin's low register in contrapuntal settings, Gruber (1994) on musical heterogeneity in \"Solche hergelauf'ne Laffen,\" and both Bauman (1987, 62--71) and Mahling (1973) on the dramaturgic use of the eighteenth-century *alla turca* style in Osmin's music. For more general considerations of Osmin's character, see Abert ([1919--1921] 2007, 658--85), Betzwieser (1991), and Fábián (1989). For a concise and eloquent account of the syntactical musical challenge that Osmin's rage presented Mozart, see Kivy (1999, 59--61). "
footnote_2: "It should be noted that the distinctive low notes and broad leaps of Osmin's vocal lines, though often employed dramaturgically by Mozart, were included in no small part to exploit the particular abilities of Ludwig Fischer (1745--1825), the star bass-baritone who premiered the role. Fischer was known for his exceptionally wide range as well as for the fluidity with which he traversed it. For more on his life, voice, and Viennese popularity, see Fischer (2016) and Bauman (1987). "
footnote_3: "For broader reflections on the relationship between rhythm and meter, see Rothstein (1989; 2008; 2011) and Hasty (1997); on this relationship in Mozart's music, see Mirka (2009) and Klorman (2016). "
footnote_4: "In a quadruple hypermeasure, for instance, the first measure is strong, the second weak, the third slightly less strong than the first, and the fourth weakest of all. The term \"hypermeasure\" originates in Cone (1968). "
footnote_5: "For analyses that probe the expressive potential of irregular hypermeter, see Cohn (1992) and Rodgers (2011). On types of metric dissonances beyond the hypermetric, see Krebs (1987). "
footnote_6: "Rothstein observes that pieces which intentionally invoke improvisation, such as the Baroque toccata or Classical fantasia, \"avoid forming hypermeasures in order to preserve a rhapsodic or capricious quality\" (1989, 13). "
footnote_7: "Such accents, as Malin importantly qualifies, are not the type dependent upon the interpretation of the performer but rather those that inherently \"draw attention to themselves\" (2010, 41); Krebs further notes that they can represent \"any perceptible deviation from an established pattern\" (1999, 23). Regarding the assessment of strong and weak measures, see also Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983) and Rothstein (2011); for more on the determination of metric hierarchy within and outside of hypermeter, see Malin (2010, 35--66). "
footnote_8: "The *accento comune* is the accented penultimate syllable typical of Italian verse. "
footnote_9: "As summarized by Rothstein, metrical preference rules (MPRs) \"provide criteria for deciding which of the possible structures is preferred by a listener in a given instance\" (2011, 94). These include, for example, the \"Harmony Rule\" (aligning strong beats with harmonic changes) and the \"Linguistic Stress Rule\" (aligning strong beats with stressed syllables). For more on MPRs see Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), Temperley (2001), and Rothstein (2011). "
footnote_10: "It should be noted that despite this recommendation, Rothstein (2008; 2011) encourages flexibility in metric analysis, cautioning against the blanket application of theories with \"German bias\" to Italian- and French-language music and exploring how poetic accent can render measures strong and weak (and especially so at phrase endings). "
footnote_11: "Another important example, though a bit more modest than those cited above, is Elvira's offset entrance in \"Ah, chi mi dice mai\" as a symptom of her bewilderment (Allanbrook 1986, 234). For an additional analysis of meter and text-setting in \"Ach, Belmonte! ach mein Leben,\" see Bastone (2017, 199--224). "
footnote_12: "It is worth noting that *Die Entführung aus dem Serail* premiered on July 16, 1782, at Vienna's Burgtheater. Mozart set a libretto adapted especially for him by Gottlieb Stephanie der Jüngere (director of Joseph II's National Singspiel) from an original by Christoph Friedrich Bretzner titled *Belmont und Constanze*. "
footnote_13: "For a thorough account of the indebtedness of the Singspiel to French and other international models, see Reiber (1994). Abert's commentary on this topic also endures ([1919--1921] 2007, 643--57). "
footnote_14: "We will have occasion to revisit the roots of Osmin's character type below, but on its crudeness and prevalence in the Oriental Singspiel, see Baron-Woods (2008, 72--74) and Hunter (1998); on musical and dramatic norms for buffo roles in opera buffa, see Platoff (1990) and Hunter (1999, 95--155); and on Osmin's links to the buffo tradition, see Abert ([1919--1921] 2007, 659--61). "
footnote_15: "Osmin's small outburst midway through the third stanza (mm. 40--44) poses a melodic but not structural change to that verse. "
footnote_16: "A suffix is a type of expansion that extends the concluding harmony of a phrase but sits outside the established hypermeter. For more on this common device, see Rothstein (1989, 70--73). One could make the case that m. 15 is a hypermetric elision, as described by Burkhart (1994), but I prefer viewing it as a suffix because Osmin's second-beat \"Tra-la\" exhibits a parallel hypermetric function to the vocal upbeats in mm. 2, 6, and 10, which precede hyperbeats. This parallelism is, to my ear, quite pronounced in performance, especially because of the mid-measure rests in the accompaniment (in m. 15). "
footnote_17: "For more on hypermetric transitions in Mozart (and beyond), see Temperley (2008) and Bakulina (2017). "
footnote_18: "A trochee consists of a stressed (or \"long\") syllable followed by an unstressed (or \"short\") syllable. Trochaic tetrameter, trimeter, and dimeter feature four, three, and two trochees per poetic line, respectively. "
footnote_19: "For more on the common features of eighteenth-century *alla turca* style, see Schubart ([1806] 1975), Ratner (1980), Hunter (1998), and Locke (2009); for more on Mozart's use of it in the *Entführung*, see Baumann (1987). "
footnote_20: "Mozart asked Stephanie to expand Osmin's role, at least in part, to help win the audience's favor. The Viennese loved to laugh and they loved to hear Ludwig Fischer (the singer who premiered the part); Osmin's increased presence ensured they would have more of both. For more on this calculation and the long gestation of the *Entführung* libretto, see Bauman (1987). "
footnote_21: "On the Type 2 sonata form, see Hepokoski-Darcy (2006, 353--87). In Example 3b and throughout this analysis, P = primary theme, TR = transition, S = secondary theme, C = closing zone, and the apostrophe (') represents the medial caesura. By \"rotation,\" I refer to a full \"cycle through the governing layout (P TR ' S),\" including post-S closing zones, where they exist (Hepokoski-Darcy 2006, 353). "
footnote_22: "That Rotation 2 begins with P in the submediant rather than the dominant represents for Hepokoski-Darcy a second-level default (2006, 373). In *Idomeneo*, Mozart twice similarly represents Elettra's mental instability at the same formal juncture: her \"Tutte nel cor vi sento\" is in D minor but begins its Rotation 2 in C minor and her \"D'Oreste d'ajace\" is in C minor but begins its Rotation 2 over a chromatic passage (and then the dominant). "
footnote_23: "The five-measure phrase (mm. 12--16), as shown in Example 6, is comprised of 4 + 1. Example 6 interprets mm. 12--16 as projecting a regular alternation of strong and weak measures. One could convincingly argue that all of these measures are strong owing to the similar rhythmic contents of mm. 12--15 and the ***fp*** markings that punctuate each downbeat. I favor the alteration of strong and weak measures because of the suspensions in the winds, which clearly mark only the downbeat of m. 12. "
footnote_24: "Allanbrook (1983) insightfully discusses the (extra)musical significance of *alla breve* meter in the broader eighteenth century as well as in Mozart's operas. "
footnote_25: "We will have cause to discuss the *ottonario* in more detail below, but regarding this common setting, see Webster (1991, 130--40) and Lippmann (1978); on the related \"Italian barring,\" see Rothstein (2008; 2011). "
footnote_26: "I interpret the alternating strong and weak measures in this six-measure passage according to Rothstein's \"Parallelism Rule,\" which is rooted in the early-twentieth-century work of Eugen Tetzel: \"When a motive is immediately repeated at the same or another pitch level, in the same or another voice, the strongest beat in the first statement is normally stronger than the strongest beat in the second statement\" (2011, 96). I read m. 22 as strong because of the accented downbeat, which occurs after three beats of rest. "
footnote_27: "I interpret Osmin's m. 23 as strong according to two MPRs outlined by Rothstein (2011, 96): the \"Event Rule,\" which aligns strong beats with event-onsets (the event being Osmin's reentrance after a full measure of rest), and the aforementioned Linguistic Stress Rule (the preference to align a strong beat with a strong syllable). "
footnote_28: "By \"multivalent interpretation,\" I build on the term \"multivalence\" as defined by Webster (1991, 103--4): \"temporal patternings\" of various \"domains\" (rhythm, meter, melodic content, text, etc.) \"are not necessarily congruent and may even be incompatible,\" and \"the resulting complexity and lack of unity is often a primary source of their effect.\" "
footnote_29: "Burton hears this shift to recitative-like style as a marker of Osmin's \"unsteadiness\" and borrows the Greek term *metabole* to describe the illustrative musical function of the pauses (2004, 366--73). Burton presents a sensitive analysis of the aria, taking into account the dramatic implications of phrasing and meter (especially in the second coda). "
footnote_30: "The only significant (non-harmonic) difference between P in Rotations 1 and 2 is the compression of mm. 18--19 into one (m. 72). "
footnote_31: "Webster also rightly observes that when Mozart remarked to his father during the composition of the *Entführung* that \"verses are doubtless the most indispensable thing for music,\" he likely meant that \"poetic lines . . . imply tangible rhythmic profiles\" (1991, 132). For another excellent source on Mozart's rhythmic profiles and how they compare in his settings of German and Italian texts, see Lippmann (1978). On rhythmic profiles and their dramaturgic functions in the *Entführung*, see Bastone (2017, 49--84). "
footnote_32: "Mozart explained to his father, in the same letter quoted at the outset of this article, that \"[t]he passage 'Drum beim Barte des Propheten' is indeed in the same tempo, but with quick notes,\" implying that the faster declamation was meant to reflect Osmin's \"gradually\" increasing rage (Anderson 1997, 769). "
footnote_33: "Hepokoski-Darcy calls this TR the \"defining feature\" of the sonata-rondo (2006, 394), repeatedly noting that when A and B are \"merely juxtaposed thematic blocks\" with no transition between them, the formal structure does \"not rise fully to the level of the 'sonata-rondo' in the strictest sense of the term\" (2006, 402--4). It should be noted that episodes 2 and 3 of \"O! wie will ich triumphieren\" do feature at their conclusions transitional passages of dominant preparation for the return of the tonic refrain. "
footnote_34: "Although offered at a different pitch level, Osmin's expansion via \"schnüren zu\" is a textual and rhythmic repetition that recalls Kirnberger's concept of echo-repetition: \"one can repeat the last measure of a three-measure phrase as an echo and thus form from them a rhythmic unit of four measures\" ([1793] 1982, 410). "
footnote_35: "Rodgers (2011) as well as De Souza (2019), who notably reports a corpus study of hypermetrical irregularity in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century symphonic sonata movements, both observe the rarity of extended passages of triple hypermeter. "
footnote_36: "Truncated refrains were common in the second and third rotations in of the late-eighteenth-century rondo (see Hepokoski-Darcy 2006, 388--403). Section A′′ diverges from A at m. 199, where Osmin delves into obsessive textual fragmentation that the orchestra underpins with incessant cadential gestures in order that he might finish the aria with a real bang. A quadruple hypermeter persists throughout. Of this vocal material, Abert wrote that \"Osmin is no longer capable of forming an orderly melodic line but simply avails himself of odd phrases and fragments of his main theme, flogging them to death in his delight at the thought of imminently strangling his enemies\" ([1919--1921] 2007, 683). "
footnote_37: "The second violins begin with an ascending minor third in mm. 87--88 but follow the stepwise pattern of the violas, cellos, and basses thereafter. "
footnote_38: "The ***fp*** marking, registral shift, and change of accompanimental figuration are tempting reasons to interpret m. 96 as metrically strong. I favor hearing it as weak, though, because it prolongs the G minor harmony attained in m. 95 (an unequivocally strong measure) through to m. 97. Moreover, even strong accents like the downbeat ***fp*** of m. 96 do not automatically oblige strong measures; Cone asserts that \"there is no necessary correlation between strong measures and dynamic accents\" (1968, 31). "
footnote_39: "The repetition features new figuration in the accompaniment and the inclusion of the oboe and bassoon (not shown in Example 11); additionally, the harmonic goal is the dominant of D in preparation for the refrain's return in m. 132. We might also note that the low strings and vocal part suggest a canon between mm. 111--119, subtly echoing the \"stalking\" narrative first introduced in mm. 87--95. (I am indebted to an anonymous reader of *Theory and Practice* for this clever observation.) "
footnote_40: "The quoted passage is that which opens the aria's second coda with the text \"Erst geköpft, dann gehangen\" (in the aria, starting at m. 147; in the finale, at m. 75). "
footnote_41: "On Osmin's interest in Blonde and its effect on his character, see Fábián (1989), Mahling (1973), and Joncus (2010). "
footnote_42: "Osmin continues with a regular quadruple hypermeter thereafter."
