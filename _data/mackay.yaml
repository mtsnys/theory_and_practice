## Footnotes

footnote_1: >
  Cf. Caplin (1998, 97); Burstein (2020, 38); Hepokoski and Darcy (2006, 169).
footnote_2: >
  Richards (2012, 218--219), like the authors cited above, permits the IAC as the subordinate theme's concluding cadence as an infrequent alternative to the PAC.
footnote_3: >
  The arrow signifies one formal unit "becoming" another: see Schmalfeldt (2011, 38).
footnote_4: >
  On a related note, Robert Gjerdingen's (2017) schema theory discusses many historic cadence types from the Renaissance and Baroque eras, along with their use and adaptation by mid-eighteenth-century composers.
footnote_5: >
  MacKay (2017, 1) proposes such an exclusion on historic grounds.
footnote_6: >
  Nicholas Marston (2001, 143), in a review of Caplin's *Classical Form*, was the first author to use this term, later taken up by multiple authors in reference to the revival of *Formenlehre* by Caplin, Schmalfeldt, and others.
footnote_7: >
  Earlier authors, e.g., Green (1979, 13), have a broader definition, allowing V^6^--I and vii^o6^--I progressions as IACs. This article follows Caplin's stricter criteria.
footnote_8: >
  Cf. Gjerdingen (2007, 139--41).
footnote_9: >
  Defined in Schmalfeldt 1992, 2.
footnote_10: >
  This technique often occurs at the phrase level as well; e.g., the main theme of Beethoven's Sonata in C major, Opus 2 no. 3, featuring a second phrase that terminates with an IAC, followed by a "one more time" reprise that ends conclusively with a PAC.
footnote_11: >
  Caplin (1998, 270, n.10) labels the IAC of m. 54 as the *end* of the subordinate theme, implicitly reading the tonic arrival of m. 28 (or 37?) as this theme's onset. This reading is contrary to previous authors, including Grave and Grave (2006, 298), Keller (1986, 283), Landon (1976, Vol. 3, 480), and Barrett-Ayres (1974, 206). Hepokoski and Darcy (2006, 169) do not discuss this movement, though it fits their discussion of the C-space taking on some responsibilities of cadential articulation.
footnote_12: >
  On "popular style" in closing zones, see Miyake (2009, 34) and Rosen (1998a, 327--350).
footnote_13: >
  If one labels m. 58 as the beginning of the codetta---Donald Francis Tovey (1998, 190) calls it a "cadence theme"---the analytical result for mm. 50--65 (Subordinate Theme→Codetta fused function) remains unchanged.
footnote_14: >
  Larsen discusses this type of exposition as illustrating one of many "sonata form problems" (Graue 2013, 9-10). Caplin and Martin (2016, 5--7) label such a segment as Transition/Subordinate Theme, suggesting a fusion of middle and ending formal roles. Hepokoski and Darcy (2006, 53) invoke Schmalfeldt's "becoming" rather than formal fusion, labeling this central unit as TR→FS (Transition→*Fortspinnung*).
footnote_15: >
  Schmalfeldt (2011, 67) describes this reinterpretation as retransition→recapitulation, which focuses on the specific formal joint that the composer reinterprets.
footnote_16: >
  This cadence is a "covered PAC," described in Zhang (2022, 6--7). Yust (2016) presents a related case (Beethoven, op. 59, no. 2, first movement).
footnote_17: >
  The formal design of this part of the exposition corresponds to the "Elaboration Section" described in Larsen (1978/2013, 9--10), "Continuous Exposition," subtype 1, from Hepokoski and Darcy (2006, 52--60), and Transition/Subordinate Theme fusion, discussed in Caplin (1998, 203).
footnote_18: >
  Caplin (2018, 4) posits "a lack of cadential closure for thematic units" as a hallmark of early Romantic style. A later passage from Schumann's *Carnaval*, discussed in Caplin (2018, 15), provides a strategy similar to Beethoven's op. 110: a cover tone (\^5) obscures an expected PAC at the end of a formal unit.
footnote_19: >
  Gjerdingen (2007, 139--76) summarizes this earlier concept of cadence.
