The editors of Theory and Practice welcome submissions on any topic within the field of music theory. Manuscripts may be any length up to 10,000 words, but we especially encourage shorter submissions, including those within the range of 1,500 to 3,500 words. Our desire to publish shorter-format works reflects the founding principles of the journal, which in its early years was a forum for authors to share their ideas in lengths roughly comparable to a spoken conference presentation. We accept submissions on a rolling basis, without any deadline.
 
All submission to Theory and Practice are sent out for peer review using a double-blind process. Manuscripts should be e-mailed to theoryandpractice@mtsnys.org in one of two file formats, PDF or DOCX. All submissions should also include an abstract (of no more than 250 words), either in the manuscript itself or as a separate file. Any large files (e.g., audio examples) should be submitted as links rather than through e-mail. Details about the formatting guidelines for accepted articles can be found at the Theory and Practice website (INSERT LINK), but there are no formatting requirements for manuscripts under review. Theory and Practice is digitally archived in JSTOR and ProQuest, and published authors are provided with a PDF of their printed article.
